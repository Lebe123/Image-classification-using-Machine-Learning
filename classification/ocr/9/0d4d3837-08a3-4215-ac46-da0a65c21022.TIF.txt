‘Cigarette Ads
“The Federal Communications Com.
mission would like to bar cigarette adver-
tising from television and radio, By a six

+ to one vote, the commission adopted a
regulation banning the advertising and it
will become effective unless Congress al-
lows the present labelling provision to
lapse on July 7.

‘The commission holds power over TV
and radio because of the necessity for
licensing. Both use the public airways and
have exclusive rights to assigned chan-
nels in their own territories. They are,
therefore, not ‘in the same position as
newspapers and other publications, which
hhave no such exclusive rights and do not

. make use of public property,
Nevertheless, since TV and radio are
allowed to carry advertising, and since
‘cigarettes are legal, the commission's posi-
tion is unsound. It should be possible to ad.
vertise anything that can be legally of-
fered for sa‘e.

On a selfish basis, newspapers. might
be inclinea to approve the commission's
ban, Television took in about 264 million
dollars from cigarette manufacturers last
year and newspaper income from them
hhas declined to a dribble, But the prin.
ciple involved is more important than...

lars. If the FOC is so desperately concern.
ed about the use of cigarettes, it should
Propose that ail sale of them ke prohibited.

| Cigaret Advertising

Congress in 1985 authorized the
Federal Trade Commission to print
‘a health warning notice on every
package of cigarets sold. At the
same time, as a sop to the tobacco
Industry, it ordered there should be
no restrictions on cigaret advertising
until June 30, 1969.

‘That date is now approaching. The
Issue is joined by the fact the Fed-
eral Communications Commission
has proposed the complete ban of
radio and television advertising, if
Congress lets it have authority in
this field.

So another battle royal will be
Joined in coming weeks. The good
guys will argue that since cigarets
have been proved a serious health
menace, the advertising of them
‘over broadcast media should be halt-
ed to keep the young in particular
from being enticed.

‘The bad guys will refute the charge
as best they can. Cigaret advertisers
provide the broadcasters with sev-
eral hundred million dollars annual-
ly, and this they are not going to
give up willingly.

The broadcasters have other fac-
tors working in their favor. Several
members of Congress have radio or
‘TV interests. Still more have close
personal friends and campaign con-
tributors among big names in the
world. There is a conflict of interest
here, but it will be resolved in fa-
vor of the status quo.

Unless the public becomes much
more concerned about this matter
than it yet has been, the bad guys
are much more likely to prevail. The
customary plethora of cigaret com-
mercials is to be anticipated when
the new programs are screened next
fall.
