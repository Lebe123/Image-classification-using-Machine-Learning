LAWHARERS BASK IN TOBACCO INSTITUTE'S WARMTH.

Rep. Hovard Coble, R-N.C., punched a vinning volley in his stadium court
tennis match at the Hyatt Grand Champions resort.

Rep. Don Sundquist, R-Tenn., teed off vith a drive straight dovn the
fairvay at the adjacent Indian Wells Golf Resort.

Rep. Alex McMillan, R-N.C., arrived for dinner in a tan-and-green
checked sport coat, a vivid contrast to the stark Dlues and grays he typically
Vears for Congress. ‘'Nice jacket,'' commented a member of his party. ‘'I only
vear this on junkets to California,'' ne joked.

Those members of Congress and about 20 others vere enjoying an all-
expense-paid life last veek at the fifth annual legislative conference of
the Tobacco Institute. That's the association of cigarette makers and other
tobacco interests, vhich after 25 years of surgeon generals’ varnings on the
dangers of smoking, insists that smoking cannot be directly linked to cancer,
heart disease or stroke.

The tobacco industry has good reason to get together vith lavmakers. It
faces a range of attacks this year, from proposals to raise cigarette taxes to
@ ban on tobacco advertising. Not surprisingly, most members of Congress in
attendance either hail from tobacco-producing states or sit on key tax,
commerce and other committees that handle bills affecting the industry.

So vhile official Washington searched the forecasts for snov last veer, the
tobacco folk and lavmakers, many accompanied by their spouses, enjoyed the sun
and palm trees at a tvo-year-old Southern California hotel that has 12 tennis
courts, 4 svimming pools, 3 restaurants and 2 18-hole golf courses, and vhere
the cheapest room costs $200 a night.

The Tobacco Institute hired bands for dinner and dancing, as vell

In addition to Coble and McMillan, Carolinas lavmakers attending at least
part of the four-day conference vere: Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Reps. Tim
Valentine, D-N.C., Martin Lancaster, D-N.C., Steve Neal, D-W.C., Charlie Rose,
D-N.C., Bill Hefner, D-N.C., and Robin Tallon, D-S.C. Ail but Neal, Hefner and
Coble, a bachelor, brought their vives.

In addition to travel expenses, most of the lavmakers vill receive a
$1,000 honorarium, a kind of appearance fee. They earned it basically by
attending a 90-minute seminar to discuss political issues vith some 125
cigarette manufacturers and other Tobacco Institute members.

Some heavy hitters, such as Helms and Rep. Dan Rostenkovski
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, gave individual talks.

The honoraria are legal. Many lavmakers rely on the fees to increase
their income beyond the $89,500 annual salary for senators and
representatives.

Still, lavmakers acknovledge that the payments offered by special
interest groups can pose political problems. The nev Congress may vote on
vhether to abolish honoraria as part of a plan to raise lavmakers' salaries to
$135,000.
