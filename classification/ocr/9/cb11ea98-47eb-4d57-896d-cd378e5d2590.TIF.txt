Dany ews stat Wr
‘The world’s largest tobacco
company is recalling billions
ofcigarets because they may
/nave contaminated filters.

Philip Morris S.A. offi-
fals Tanned out across. the
country to take back Mari-
boros. Virginia Slims and oth~
ef brands that might be caint-
ed with a chemical that could
cause smokers what the com-
pany called “temporary dis-
comfort.”

The other brands involved
are Merit, Basic, Cambridge,
Alpine, Bristol, Premium Buy,
Best Buy, Shield and Bronson’

The contaminated cigarets
feature a filter that gives off a
noticeable odor and metallic
taste — and smoking them
‘might irritate the eyes, nose
and throat or cause dizziness,
coughing and wheezing

‘The Manhattan-based com-
pany said it believes the con-
taminated cigarets are at the
wholesale level and have not
been sold to consumers,

“Philip Morris USA has
decided, out of an abundance
of caution, to recall all of the
brand packings that are in-
volved,” company President
James Morgan said in a state-
ment.

A company spokesman,

 

 

Larry Wexler, added that the
nationwide recall—-the first
in his memory — involves
“less than a week's worth of
production,

Philip Morris U.S.A. makes
about 43 billion cigarets a
week.

‘The road to the recall began
week ayo, when an unusual
‘odor was detected in raw ma-
terials used to make filters. By
Wednesday, tests had re-
vealed the presence of methyl
isothiocyanate in the filters of
some cigarets.

‘The affected cigarets were
placed on hold, but on Thurs:
day subsequent testing dis:
closed the presence of the
chemical in cigarets without
the odor — raising fears that
the tainted product already
might have been sent to
wholesalers.

Wexler said the company
has not heard from any con-
sumers so far. “We're just be-
ing overly cautious,” he said

Philip Morris said consum-
ers with any of the listed
brands should return the
Packs to a retailer that carries
the product for a refund,

Consumers, wholesalers or
retailers with questions may
call (800) 757-2555, 24 hours @
day, seven days a week.
