Ignoring smoking warnings

Washington — The tobacco com-
panies’ long. deliberate campaign to
undereut government warnings on
the hazards of cigarette smoking has
been astonishingly successful, ac-
cording to internal industry ‘doc-
uments that have been suppressed
by court order.

‘The Federal Trade Commission
recently reported that the health
‘waming on every pack of cigarettes
is ineffective, and the industry's own
studies support this conclusion, But
2 federal judge acceded to the tobac-
co companies’ request that doc-
uments subpoenaed by the FTC be
locked up. The section of the agen
cey's report that discusses the doc-
uments has also been withheld from
the public.

My associate Tony Capaccio has
seen the suppressed material. One
document in particular illustrates
just how ineffective the govern:
ment’s many warnings about ciga-
Fettes have been. It is a 1977 survey
by the firm of Yankelovich, Skelly
and White for the Brown & Wiliam
‘son Tobaceo Corp.

Here are some of its findings:

* NEARLY ONE-FOURTH of the
nation’s cigarette smokers do not
believe that smokers die younger
than non-smokers.

Twenty-two percent of the gen-
‘eral population, including 32 percent
of smokers, were not aware that
‘smoking increases the risk of any
type of cancer.

‘* Twenty-three percent of the
population (and 38 percent of smok-
fers) believed the statement, “They.
still haven't proven that smoking.
‘causes lung cancer.”

* Thirty-eight percent of the
population (and nearly half the
T

 

smokers) did not know that smoking
increases the risk of heart disease.
* A particularly reprehensible
feature of the cigarette companies"
‘multimilliondollar advertising cam-
Paigns has been their accent on
youth — devising means to hook
‘young people on the smoking habit

For example, a 1975 ad plan pre-

pared for Brown & Williamson sug-
ested these ways to attract “start-
ers” to smoke Viceroy cigarettes,

“Present the cigarette as one
of the few initiations into the adult
world.”

* “TO THE BEST of your abili-
ty, relate the cigarette to ‘pot,’ wine,
beer, sex, etc.”

= “Don't communicate health or
health related points.” The word
“Don’t was underlined for empha-
sis

‘The suppressed section of the
FTC report has this to add: “B&W
documents show that it translated
the advice on how to attract ‘start.
ers" into an advertising campaign
featuring young adults in situations
that the vast'majority of young
People probably would experience
and in situations demonstrating
adherence to a ‘free and easy,
hedonistic lifetyle.""

Another example of the cigarette
makers’ deliberate targeting of
young people is his quote from the

 

 

“Through the association of
Salem and its brand styles with
emulatable personalities that are
‘compatible with the aspirations and
styles of contemporary young
adults. this important target seg.
ment will be attracted to the brand.

assistant secretary of defense for
international security affairs. Perle
said the 1978 charges were “a scahe
dalous attack initiated by a pro.
fessional lobbying organization

's White House budget-cutters ap
parently want to dismantle the anti-

CSA assistant chief. Congressional
investigators also want a closer look
at the agency's books. They've al
ready uncovered serious misman-
agement, and now suspect there's
fraud in some of the agency's com
tracts as well.
