TORONTO (AP) - Canada and its provinces levy 400 percent taxes
on cigarettes trying to force people to stop smoking, but now they
find the remedy to one problem has created another -’ smuggling.

Contraband cigarettes account for as much as 75 percent of the
market in Quebec and 40 percent in Ontario, the country’s two most
populous provinces. That led to a retailers’ rebellion last week.

Shopkeepers in Quebec banded together to defy the law by selling
contraband cigarettes at cut-rate prices, first at St. Eustache,
near Montreal, then at Sherbrooke. They openly sold smuggled
cigarettes for 20 Canadian dollars ($15) a carton instead of the
retail price of 48 Canadian dollars ($36).

No charges have been filed against the merchants, who claim the
smugglers are driving legitimate retailers out of business, and
more such sales are planned.

“The government has to take control of the black market and
realize that our cause is justified and that they have to lower the
tax," said Guy Belisle, a spokesman for retailers’ Movement to
Abolish Cigarette Taxes.

Prine Minister Jean Chretien seems to be listening. He told the
House of Commons that negotiations are underway with the provinces
to cut cigarette taxes.

“We hope to have an agreement in the coming days," he said.

"If not, we will act in a unilateral fashion."

Solicitor General Herb Gray said the government is working on
measures to combat the smuggling.

Health organizations oppose any reduction in the taxes.

Most of the cigarettes on the black market are made in Canada,
exported legally to the United States, then smuggled back into
Canada, frequently through the Mohawk Indian Reserve at Akwasasne,
straddling the borders of New York, Quebec and Ontario.

The Indians claim their aboriginal rights exempt them from
paying or collecting taxes.

Canadian tobacco companies - Imperial Tobacco, RJR-Macdonald and
Rothman, Benson’ and Hedges - exported 17.4 billion cigarettes last
year, and most went to the United States, according to Statistics
Canada, Ottawa's official number cruncher. That is more than double
the 1992 figure and five times more than 1990.

Police estimate as much as 90 percent of those exports are
smuggled back into Canada.

‘The cigarette companies deny they have any contact with
smugglers but acknowledge the dramatic increase in exports is
because of contraband.

“We do not sell to smugglers directly," said Rob Parker,
president of the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers Council. "We sell
to a very limited number of companies well known in the U.S.
Obviously, three or four transactions later, the smugglers get
their hands on this product and get it back’across the border."

Smugglers can obtain a carton of 200 Canadian cigarettes in the
United states for 15 Canadian dollars ($11.25) and sell it here for
28 Canadian dollars ($21), making a profit while still undercutting
the legal price of about 48 Canadian dollars ($36).

“The industry has not caused smuggling," said Parker. “It is
caused by the taxes and the huge profits that are available."
