“Masters Deg ooo
Ten apoot, ‘THE NATION'S largest tobacco company, Philip Mortis, just
Peace eames, concluded an agreement to buy threc brands of cigarettes from its
alee smaller rival, the Liggett Group. The brands, assuming the deal goes

 

through, will be accompanied by a minor problem.

Liggett, an industry maverick, put a waming label on its cigarettes in
1997 that "smoking is addictive." No other cigarette company does
so, and Philip Morris has resisted such an acknowledgment, an
SunliyOulook advocacy group, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, observed the
FrontPage Aticles other day. In congressional testimony in 1994, a Philip Morris

executive denied that smoking is addictive. In testimony last year, the
Qn Our Site company's chief executive would say only that "under certain

Hee circumsiances," smoking may be addictive.

Opinion

 

  

‘The brands are Lark, L&M and Chesterfield. If Philip Mortis takes
them over, does it retain the warning on them, extend it to its own
fo 129 B43¥428e,9] brands or drop it? Not an unimportant question if you believe, as we

do, that over time such wamings have a cumulative effect and do
deter people from smoking.

 

 

 

Philip Morris declines to discuss its deal with Liggett on grounds that
it is under review by federal regulators. The company has, however,
announced that it will mount a new ad campaign meant to deter
young people from taking up smoking. That would argue for
acknowledging that tobacco is addictive whether the Liggett deal
goes through or not,
