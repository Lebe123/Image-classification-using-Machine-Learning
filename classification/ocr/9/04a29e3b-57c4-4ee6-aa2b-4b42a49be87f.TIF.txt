CIGARETTES ON
UP.BEAT AGAIN

‘The relationship between cigarette
smoking and lung cancer 1s 48 ob-
scure as before the big storm blew
up over a year ago, according to Dr.
Clarence Cook Little, chairman of
the sclentifie advisory board of the
‘Tobacco Research Industry Commlt-
tee. Since there are 20 many poe
sible causes of cancer, it 18 pos
sible that no one element, such as
some found in cigarettes, might ever
be blamed as & positive, unfailin
cause. As fer as the American pub-
Me {a concemed, it seems to concur

\D decause clearette sales have partial-

‘%) ly retaken the heights they bad a

Q couple of years ago. Like anybody
‘who Isn't sure, but is willing to be

\ cautious, a large seement of the

X population has shifted to Altertip

Q)cleareties. In the long drive by the
clearette manufacturers to regain
their position against the original
“moral'*-medical attack on smoking,
promotion of all types has played &
major part. Originally only one side
was heard from and the cigarette
makers were in a disorganized re-
treat, the public had to go along with
medical opinion, As soon as the
posttive voice of ‘maybe, but no
fone really knows" was beard, then
the public started to look’ more
closely at the situation, Also,
peoples’ habits are pernicious; they
may oe subdued, but they are never
really eradicated. Effective promo-
ton brought home to people the post-
tive element of doubt, positive from
the viewpoint of the clearette
people, because even Dr. Little
points out that no one knows as yet

A bit of proof for special situa
tions that sometimes @ quick retort
can be worse thon the temporary no
defense at all. The cigarette people
100k too long a time to make wp their
minds, but the element thot hos
worked, based on medical facts, is
“tno one really knows.’
