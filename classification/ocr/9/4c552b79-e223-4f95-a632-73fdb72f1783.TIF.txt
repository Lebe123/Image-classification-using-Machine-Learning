I am constantly amazed . . . . and quite discouraged
«by the number of youngsters in this county who,be-

 

conté' Slaves to a cigarett? habit at a tender age.

Tt is not an, undonitnon sight to seb 12, 18, and 14-year-

old-boys sauntering down the streets of Pulaski with
cigarettes drooping from thelr mouths. It's not too un-
‘common to’see boys below the age of 12 smoking.

As far as I can determine there is no law against a
minor either buying or smoking cigarettes. Many states
have laws which prevent minors from purchasing ¢ig;
arettes, but not Virginia. | :

The disturbing part of the ‘whole business is the health
factor. I, think most of us will agree with the National
‘Health Department that cigarettes have definitely beeh
linked Yo ling cancer. THe Ticldence of heart failure
runs higher for heavy smokers. Yet there are parents who
‘ignore these warnings and show no worry whatever when
their children-start_ smoking.

Recently I asked a 13-year-old boy if his father knew
he smoked. The boy replied that he did, and his father
evén bummed cigarettes from him.

“The ‘American Cancer Society has recently completed
a/study of smoking habits of students in'the Portland,
oe area. I think their findings were of interest, nd

 

reprint them here: q ke
. ‘The percentage of smokers is highest among chil:
dren of families in which both parents smoke cigaréttes!
lowest in families if which neither parent has been, @
smoker, and intermediate in families in which only one,
parent smokes cigarettes,
<2. The smoking behavior of boys tends to conform
more closely to that of the father, while smoking’ bee,
havior of gitls follows more closely that of the mother.
.,The percentage of smokers among children’ from
families in which one or both parents continue to smoke
is significantly higher than the percentage in which one
or both parents gave up cigarette smoking. .
“JA, Bach successive school grade has a higher percetit-
age of smokers. *
‘5, The percentage of smokers is higher among students
jolie parochial schools, than among students in
the'ity public schools tis lowest among students in the
J subuifban public igh sehools,
6, The percentage of smokers among boys who do not j

‘Whd'do and have a coach. The percentage of smokers is
‘highet among students who.do not-participate in any
