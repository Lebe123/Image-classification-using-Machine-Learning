agenesis of lung cancer is to be found in
the effects of multiple exposure, Dr.
Mitebell added:

“While recognition and acceptance of
the concept that multiple factors are com-
cerned with the initstion and promotion
of lung cancer pose particularly complex
problems to the experimentalist, epidemio-
logical data provide several leads. The
‘growing experimental data suggesting a
role of viral agents in the pathogenesis of
neoplastic diseases direct’ us 10 studies
utilizing both oncogenic and nononcogenic
‘ruses in combination with chemical ear
inogens. The role of endogenous factors
in modifying host entry, metabolism of
carcinogens, and systemic elimination
‘must also be actively pursued."

‘Dr, Fletcher, in his paper, si

“The strongest argument that cigarette
smoking causes lung cancer is that m0
‘other hypothesis has yet been advanced
that fts all the facts s0 well. The alterna
tive hypothesis that has received most sup-

cally determined, 28 shown by the con-
