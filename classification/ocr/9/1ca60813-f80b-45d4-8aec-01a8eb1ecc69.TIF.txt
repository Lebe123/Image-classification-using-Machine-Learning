Forget the Cigarette Tax Hike; Smokers Already Pay Their Share

 

By Jane Gravelle and Dennis Zimmerman,

everything about President Clinton's health care

reform package, with one notable exception. A
‘vast majority favors the proposed 75-cent tax on a pack
of cigarettes. Were one to be cynical, such support
‘ight be explained by the fact that only about a quarter
of adult Americans smoke, so that the majority of us
anticipate receiving health care paid for by others. For-
tunately, a more charitable—and conventional—expla-
nation exists: that the 25 percent of American adults
‘who smoke impose great costs on nonsmokers, thus a
75-cent tax increase would compensate nonsmokers
for these social, or “external,” costs. If true, nonsmok-
ers can rest easy knowing that imposition of a cigarette
tax isnot only in their financial best interest, but is also
abundantly fair.

But is it, in fact, fair? Let’s take a look at the evi-
dence. The financial costs smokers impose on non-
‘smokers have been extensively examined in a 1991
study funded by the Rand Corp. Updating the study's
mid-range estimate to 1995 price levels yields a net
external cost of smoking of $3 cents per pack. Since
ccurrent federal, state and local taxes are 50 cents per

A ‘merican taxpayers seem to disagree on almost

 

pack or more on average, the RAND-sponsored study
suggests that smokers are already paying more than
their way.

‘These modest spillover costs may seem inexplicable in
light ofthe assertions of organizations that advocate tax-
es far larger than 75 cents per pack. But the Rand study
‘makes some critical distinctions many of those organiza-
tions don't aclnowledge. For instance, the Rand study
identifies ‘al of the costs and benefits that smokers im-
‘pose on others—and excludes the costs smokers pay for
themselves. Thus, the study includes as external costs
only that portion of smokers’ excess medical expendi-
tures (49 cents per pack) and sick leave costs (1 cent per
pack) not paid by smokers, the higher life and fire insur
‘ance premiums due to smoking (7 and 3 cents per pack
respectively) and the lost tax revenve smokers would
‘have paid to retirement and health programs had they
not died prematurely (12 cents per pack).

‘Additionally, the authors of the Rand study include the
offsetting savings that smokers’ premature death pro-
vides to nonsmokers—an obvious but often overlooked
factor. After al, the alternative to death from a smoking-
related illness is not immortality and perfect health—itis
later death, and perhaps from a more costly illness (net-
ted out in the 49 cents per pack above) or larger nursing
home casts (a 6 cent offset per pack). Nonsmokers may
not realize it, but they also benefit from the pension and
