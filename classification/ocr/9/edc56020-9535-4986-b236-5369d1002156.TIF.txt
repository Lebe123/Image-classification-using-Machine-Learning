 

Cigarettes Will ‘Drug’ Unborn Baby

Smoking \ cigarettes during
pregnancy apparently exerts a die
ect, drug-like effect on the un
orn baby, according to a team of
‘Swedish scientists. .

Pregnant Women

‘The Swedish team, headed by
Dr. Stig Kullander, studied 5,272
Pregnant women in 1974 ‘and
1975. They measured fetal skull
diameter by ultrasound, beginning
in the 18-20th weeks and continue
Ing through pregnancy... Thé dif-
ference between the measurement
in smokers: and nonsmokers “be
‘came significantly apparent from
the 28th week onward, and corre~
lated positively with the average
‘number of cigarettes smoked.”

‘The smoking women also had a

igher proportion of premature
separation of the placenta, prema
ture delivery and “babies who
were small for their gestational
age, or had a low birth welght,
short birth length or small head
circumference.

‘Other scientists were showing
‘similar results. For instance, using
mice, a Rockland Research Inst
tute, New York, team showed nic~
tine decreased the synthesis of

 

 

 

 

proteins in the brain of newborn
mice.

‘At Georgetown University In
Washington, Dr. Margit Hamosh
and her colleagues were showing
that high doses of nicotine’ re=
duced rat litter size and increased
stilbicths.

Furthermore, in the second
‘week after birth, newborns of nic-
otinestreated rats did not progress
as rapidly as those of nicotine-tree
rats, and the weight difference
Feached 40 percent after 12 days.
‘The researchers suggested “nico:

fecting the development of
offspring during a period of ray
growth. i

Animal Studies
At Wayne State University and

 

 

Harvard University, scientists in|. rg

separate animal studies were
showing @ plethora of nicotine ef-
fects early in pregnancy. Nicotine
slowed growth, slowed implanta-
tion of the embryo on the wall of
the uterus, lowered production of
some hormones and increased oth-
ers, and otherwise made pregnan-
cy more difficult.
