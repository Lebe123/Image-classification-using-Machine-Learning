Two Democratic State Senators from Los Angeles, Alex Garcia
and Bill Greene, today declared their opposition to defeat
Proposition § on the November ballot.

"This smoking prohibitions measure is unnecessary," Senator
Garcia said. "California does't need a law regulating conduct
that should be a matter of individual responsibility, common

sense, and personal courtesy

 

Senator Greene declared:

“California taxpayers have shown that they are fed up with
the burden being placed upon them. Proposition 5 requires an
extensive system of signs to be placed at every entrance to
every state and local givernment building. This is a ridiculous
waste of taxpayer dollars!"

Co-chairment of Californians for Common Sense, the organization
campaigning for defeat of Proposition S, are John F. Henning,
executive secretary-treasurer of the California Labor Federation
(AFL-CIO), Houston I. Flournoy, dean of the University of
Southern California Center for Public Affairs, and Katherine B.

Dunlap, prominet conservationist and civic leader.
