THE LATEST CIGARETTE TAR AND NICOTINE TEST RESULTS
FROM THE FTC SHOW A CONTINUING, THOUGH RELATIVELY
SMALL, DECLINE IN AVERAGE TAR AND NICOTINE YIELDS,
SENATOR WARREN G. MAGNUSON (D-WASH,), CHAIRMAN OF

‘THE SENATE COMMERCE COMMITTEE, TODAY NOTED IN
RELEASING THE LATEST FTC DATA,

Since the last tests in November, 1969, 32
varieties of cigarettes tested had gone down in
tar while 63 stayed the same and 17 increased. In
nicotine, 46 decreased, 55 stayed the same, 11 increased.

Compared with the FTC's first series of tests

in October, 1968, the latest results show 68 varieties
decreased in tar, 26 unchanged, and 11 increased
while 34 varieties decreased in nicotine, 41 are
unchanged, and 30 have increased.

Senator Magnuson commented, “In light of recent
disturbing signs that young people continue to take
up smoking, despite intensive and skillful anti-smoking
campaigns, it becomes increasingly important that the
manufacturers produce and the smoking public consume
progressively less hazardous cigarettes."
