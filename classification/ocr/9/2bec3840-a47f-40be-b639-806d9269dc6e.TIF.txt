pediatric and public health journals have
called attention to the rather alarming in-
cidence of cigarette smoking in teen-agers
and the broader implications of this prac-

800 adolescents of both sexes disclosed that
starting about age 14 or 15, smoking by boys
becomes progressively more common until
about age 18 when 90 per cent are smoking
at least occasionally. The ineidence in girls
is somewhat less but at age 18 about 60 per
cent are smoking to some degree. Positive
associations have been found between rogue

of visits to the school health room, frequent
absences from classes and a school perform
