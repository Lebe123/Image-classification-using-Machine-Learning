In recent years, RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Philip Morris USA, and Ge

the Tobacco Institute have introduced youth-oriented education € Y \

programs on smoking. But critics simply do not buy into the
companies’ claims that they do not want young people to use or buy sent
their products. "We find their efforts to be insincere at best and ( ees \
harmful at worst," says Michael Eriksen, director of the federal Orfice R chord)
on Smoking and Health. In fact, some tobacco foes insist that the tol

‘way in which companies present smoking in these tobacco education

programs~-as a privileged decision reserved for adults only~actually

increases adolescent smoking. Dr. Joseph R. DiFranza and a

colleague caused a sti when they concluded that the campaigns

encourage tobacco use. "Children who might never have

considered tobacco use to be an option are taught that they must

make a decision about using tobacco,” DiFranza wrote. "Not

surprisingly, some decide to try it" Dr. Thomas J. Glynn of the

National Cancer Institute agrees. “Anyone who has kids 12 to 15

years old at home knows that telling them an activity is for adults

only is the surest way to get them to try it." RJ. Reynolds has

especially been blasted for its "Right Decisions, Right Now" brochure

for adolescents, which does not use the Joe Camel cartoon mascot

to deliver the anti-smoking message. Critics say if RJR really

wanted to eliminate youthful smoking, it would use Joe Camel to do

so. "If they were serious, they could use Joe Camel's imagery to get

the message out to kids not to smoke,” says Eriksen.

Passive Smoking Affects Children, Women, Studies Say*
Reuters (02/03/94)

London—Two studies to be published Friday in the British Medical
Journal report that secondhand smoke leaves physical traces in
children and can cause heart disease in women. In the first study,
Chinese researchers at the University of Hong Kong and the military
‘medical university in Xian found that women whose husbands
smoked were twice as likely to develop coronary heart disease.
‘Women whose co-workers smoked were two-and-a-half times more
likely to develop the disease. The researchers said, "Passive

‘smoking at work is a risk factor for coronary heart disease. Urgent
public health measures are needed to reduce smoking and to protect
non-smokers from passive smoking in China.” In the second study,
researchers coordinated by epidemiologist Derek Cook of St.
George's Hospital Medical School in London found that children
‘exposed to passive smoke had clear by-products of tobacco nicotine
in their saliva. The survey of more than 2,000 children measured
levels of nicotine by-product cotinine in the saliva. The researchers
‘wrote, “Our data confirm that parental smoking is the most important
source of passive exposure to smoke in young children... Overall,
‘maternal smoking contributed more to children's burden of cotinine
