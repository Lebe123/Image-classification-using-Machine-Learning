Cool It, Ralph
An advertising man created a slogan the _ cities prohibit smoking at least on elevators, and of-

felsen days of radio that apparently was intended to
Ip break the taboo against women smoking in
public. In the commercial, a woman was heard

to beat back campaigns to make ita erime to blow

‘A group of nonsmokers, having tried and failed to
persuade the Legislature to dan smoking in most
“public places,” has taken to the ballot with an
aniliative, Proposition 5, the Clean Indoor Air Act.
‘The issue on which Californians will vote in
November, asthe initiative puts it, is whether “the
right of nonsmokers to breathe clean air supersedes
the night to smoke where the two rights conflict."
‘The backers ofthe iuative think does,

Philosophically, we agree with the position of the
sponsors, but we still oppase Proposition 5. We
simply are not ready to see a conflict that can be re-
solved with common courtesy, respect for fellow

Itis a source of wonder to us that the vast majori-
ty of Americans who do not smoke suffered in
silence in smoke-filled rooms as long as they di.
Lately, however, they have been speaking up, with

couples gambol on television beaches, with some
sort of cool smoke as their reward. The surgeon

more of our friends are kicking the habit, preferring
to live dangerously by jogging. Many private com-

But we are alarmed by both the letter and the
‘spirit ofthe law that would be putin place by Prop-

of California into a smoke-detector in hotel lobbies,
student lounges in private colleges, offices of pri-

‘The tobacco'industry is spending millions of dol-

sense of a brooding government presence.

‘As for the spirt of the law, we are concerned
about the atmosphere of releniless reform that it
‘seems to carry. It isa good cause, but it has the feel
of a cause that never knows when to stop. We
worry that we might someday be watching, in the
‘golden age of television, the slogan, “Remember,
