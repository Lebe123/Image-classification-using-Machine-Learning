HUMAN CARCINOGENESIS

Six,—The Human Carsinogencsis Group under the Com-
sittee for the Coordination of Human Tumour Investigations
(CCH-TL) ata meeting in Copenhagen April 2 discussed the
US. Environmental Protection Agency's cancer principles,
‘nd agreed 0 the fellowing.

‘Since many new industrial chemicals are released into the
‘environment and may cause cancer in man, there isa need for
‘system of measures to prevent exposure of groups of workers
and the public to hazardous chemicals,

i would be a mistake to concentrate resources on texting
new chemicals wile neglecting naturally occuring of other
‘Chemicals already in ws,

‘While some cancers are clearly caused by industrial chemi
‘als, it should be recognised that mos are associated with 2
diversity of facors many of which are determined by habits of
lite ~

“These facts provide the opportunity for preventive action by
identification of adverse factors and correction of dangerous
situations. There is need for a balanced programme for the
Dractical application of present Knowledge to reduce the
Known hazards together with further epidemiological study of
carcinogenesis in man and laboratory inventigtions of new
and old chemicals, both atural and man made. A programme
‘of such compleity should not be legally dened, bt should be
recognised a8 an important area of cancer coatral, and for
sich action the following considerations may be useful

(1) Malignant neoplasms, following the elimination of
‘many cther fatal diseases, now constitute the scondmost cause
of death in the Western world, While some malignant neo
plasms sll show an increase of age-adjusted morbidity-ate,
‘thers are decreasing in incidence

(2) The fact that low merbidity-rates are found in some
parts of the world suggests that it may be poribe to reduce
rates elewhere, sinc the causes of some forms of cancer have
‘been traced to extrinsic factors, which include physical (eg.
Actinic) and chemical agents, many of which may be avoidable

(G.) The underlying process of cellular carcinogenesis seems
to be a specific biological process initiated by reaction with
calilar target macromolecules of interference with this func:
tion causing cellular change which can result in iereveruible
‘rowth, Viruses and other intracellular foreign, macromole-
‘ules may participate in carcinogenic effects,

(4.) Chemical carcinogenesis is associated with period of
induction which in man may Tast 30 years or more or, occa-
sionally, § years or even less. Additonal faciors may inlvence
{the duration ofthe induction period and may increase the mor-
bidity from cancer without producing cancer when applied
‘lone,

(5) Chemical carcinogens produce malignant neoplasms
sand may slo produce benign neoplasms in proportions Vary
ing withthe genetic constitution of the host orgenism, ss 88
‘epubility, and various (actors such as nutrition, the nature of
‘he oncogenic agent, and the site exposed.

(6. Experiments on carcinogenesis, expecially in mice, ra
snd hamsters have resulted in useful indications of possible
hhuman risks because ofthe similarity in pathology with analo-
{gous human lesions. However, most carcinogenic risks to man
‘ave been identified by clinical and epidemiological investiga-
tions.

(7) Any substance which has been shown to cause malig.
‘nant neoplasms in any mammalian species in adequately con-
ducted, repeatable and objectively evaluated experiments at
any dove level should be considered a possible carcinogenic
bhazard to man. The significance of such experiment wil vary
