A=10 (No. 87)

Despite his preference for bilateral negotiations,
Yeutter said that the Japanese would have to give in
on beef and citrus if both countries were to return to
the table.

“Tt takes two to tango, and the Japanese negotiators
were not tangoing,” 1e said. “I was getting tired of
negotiating with myself.”

 

Japanese Offer

‘The trade representative explained that Sato had
offered to remove Javanese quotas on beef over three
years, increasing the quota levels—to let in more
goods—by 10 perceni annually, and then eliminating
them entirely in the fifth year. For citrus, the Japa-
nese had offered to remove quotas after five years.

‘Yeutter explained tat the United States would have
been willing to accep: the three-year removal of beef
quotas, but that the Japanese had also wanted to
impose a type of import surcharge on US. beef in
exchange for the tariff removal. Yeutter said he could
not accept this offer, because although the quotas
would be removed, the price constraints “could be just
as onerous” as what was originally in place, he said,

With regard to citras, Yeutter said that he was not
willing to accept a f've-year tariff removal without
compensation for the U.S. citrus industry. “What we
had offered was two years, with anything over that
including a patience payment,” which, he explained is
a compensatory payinent agreed to prior to a GATT.
ruling. “We felt that live years was far too long,” he
added.

At the press confcrence, Agriculture Department
officials circulated a statement from Agriculture Sec-
retary Richard Lyng, who is currently in Fallbrook,
Calif. In the statement, Lyng said that he was
“extemely disappoint>d” that. an agreement had not.
been reached, and tiat he had supported Yeutter's|
efforts toward a resolution.) :

 

Advertising

HEALTH OFFICIALS URGE CONGRESS TO RESTRICT
CIGARETTE ADVERTISING; CHARGE DECEPTION

Representatives. of “public health groups. May 4
urged a House subconnittee to push ahead with pro-
posed legislation (HR 1532, HR 3294) to restrict or ban
cigarette advertising, charging that ads for low-tar
and low-nicotine produets are deceptive. .

‘Tobacco companies ‘are consciously deceiving the
public by using their advertising to lull smokers into
believing that so-calle4 “light” cigarettes— those con-
taining lower levels of tar and nicotine—are safe.to
smoke although there is no medical evidence that light
cigarettes pose less uf a health hazard, the public
health officials charged. .

“Consumers who pii:chase low-tar and low-nicotine
cigarettes believing that they are substantially redue-
ing their risk of heart disease, chronic obstructive
lung disease or cance are seriously mistaken,” said
Dr. Alfred Munzer..oi the Coalition on Smoking or
Health—composed of the American Heart Associ-

ation, American Lung Association, and American Can-
cer Society—told the House Energy and Commerce
Transportation, ‘Tourism, and Hazardous Materials
Subcommittee. “Advertisements which promote these
cigarettes, directly or indirectly, as significantly safer
alternatives, are patently false.” °

Dr. Robert E. Medfee, of the American Medical
Association, noted that while tobacco companies are
touting the health benefits of light cigarettes in their
advertising, medical studies show many smokers of
light cigareites end up getting about the same doses of
tar and nicotine as smokers of regular cigarettes
because they tend to inhale more deeply and smoke
more cigarettes. “There is no safe cigarette and no
safe level of tobacco consumption,” he said

McAfee charged that advertisements for light ciga-
rettes are confusing, if not outright deceptive. For
‘example, he said, cigarette makers use such labelling
terms as “low tar,” “lower tar,” “ultra low tar,"
“lights”, and “ultra’ lights” which are industry desig-
nations with no legal or medical meaning. Such terms
are “misleading and are applied to many brands
‘which do not provide lower doses of tar and nicotine,”
he said.

Scott D. Ballin, vice president for public affairs for
the Coalition on Smoking or Health, charged that the
Federal Trade Commission has failed: to take action
against deceptive low tar and nicotine advertise-
ments. Ballin said that the coalition supports HR 3294,
which’ would require “that cigarette ‘advertising be
regulated under Food and Drug Administration mat
Keting guidelines for legal drugs." - me

 

  

 

FTC Testimony

Consumers are better served:by an unregulated
advertising environment, since they are likely to bs
exposed to more information that way, FC Chairman
Daniel Oliver argued. As long as the information on
tar and nicotine content is accurate, advertisements
promoting light cigarettes “can be a’ valuable source
of information to consumers,” he said. If the advertis-
ing is deceptive, the FTC will take action against the
company, he added." we

Subcommittee chairman Rep. Thomas Luken (D-
Ohio) and ranking minority. member Bob Whittaker
(R-Kan)—who previously introduced HR 3294 and HR*
1582, which would impose a total ban on cigarette
advertising—said that they are working on another
bill which would allow states to'require more strin-
gent health warnings than federal law ‘requires. Tt
‘would also. permit plaintiffs: to bring” suit against
cigarette companies even if the companies complied
with federal warnings and it would require the FTC to
contract with either a government or private labora-
tory to conduct annual studies of tar and nicotine
levels, The laboratory would also collect data on the
average levels of other: chemicals commonly found in
cigarettes, including carbon monoxide, ammonia, cya-
nide, formaldehyde, and radioactive compounds.

The representatives expect to introduce the bill,
which is still being drafted, this week.C]
