She tells companies how to
make their new products click

ers, of how t0 take their old,
blah products and “restage”
them with fresh promises for
different target markets

She's done it for dozens of
products you'd recognize in a
second — if she could tell you
what they are, which, contrac:
tually, she usually can't. As a
result, the president of Brain-
Reserve has kept a fairly low
profile for nine years.

No more." Her struggle

be at an end,

For example, lately she has
been publicly predicting the fu

‘And telling The CocaCola

is all wrong — as Popcorn also

she ponders the significance of
the change: “It's very memora.
ble,” she says.

‘Some people say its the
greatest restaging I ever did.”

But by no means the only bit.
There were Stresstabs vita:
mins, Kool cigarettes, Ultra
Brite toothpaste, Spanada
wine, Arpege perfume and a
hhost of others, as BrainReserve
built up its “positioning” fran:
chise.

All of which is great, except
that, by Popcorn’s reckoning.
the franchise is vanishing,

“Positioning is a dead word,’
she says. “It's finished.

No longer will manufactur:
ers be able to define their own
markets simply by the way
they package and advertise
their products, she says.

“The consumer is king. They
went through two recessions
They didn't have cash and
products failed them. They
were burned, and when they
learn through burn they don’t
forget.”

These, she says. are the days
— one who demands intelli:
gent, high-quality products and
advertising that gives real in-
formation about what the prod-
uct does,

For example, she says, Coca:

 

 

 

 

Cola will find tnat consumers
will greet a jingle like "Coke is
it! with “Coke is what?”

Kellogg Co.. she says
‘should get to the point: Cora
Flakes is a healthy and nutri
tous breakfast.” And so on.

Her credibility in these mat-
ters Is built not only on her
agency's success but also on
some eerily prescient forecast-
Ing she did in 1980.

Tin no less public a forum
than The New York Times, she
predicted:

SUil, how does she suppose
the people at Coca-Cola react
when they hear her free, unso-
licited advice?

“They say, ‘She's dumb. Just
wants publicity, and what kind
of name is Popcorn”

And. they couldn't be
more wrong,
