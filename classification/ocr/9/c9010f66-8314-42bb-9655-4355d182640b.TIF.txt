‘Smokeout—the best day of the year
for smokers to quit—begins at midnight.

"At no other time is there such widespread sup-
port for taking the courageous step of kicking
the nicotine habit. Tomorrow, smokers will find
‘encouragement not just {rom the American Can-
‘cer Society, sponsor of the annual event, but also
from businesses, worksites and restaurants.

Some 5 million smokers went 24 hours with-
‘out lighting up during last year's Smokeout. The
idea is to experience being smoke-free for one
day, “even if it's just to prove to themselves that
they can doit,” says-a bulletin from the American
Cancer Society.

If some smokers try it, like it and never light up
again, well then, all the better. They can join the
‘welling ranks of former smokers—at last count
‘some 35 million people have kicked the habit since
1964, the date of the landmark surgeon generals
report linking cigarettes to cancer.

benefits of quitting. The risk of lung cancer. Em-

‘They also know the cost. Not just the $1.25 a‘

ers have more colds than nonsmokers, and their
children have more inner ear infections than chil--

‘Businesses are also jumping on the antismidk-
ing bandwagon, by restricting smoking to certain
areas and sometimes banning it altogether from
the worksite. One firm warned smokers that
they would have to pay higher health care insur-
ance premiums out oftheir own pockets if they
did't give up smoking. The company then gave

Today, with the benefit of growing research
on nicotine, no one suggests that it is a snap to

it—nor do they consider kicking the habit an
impossible task. The smoking eld, says Univer-
