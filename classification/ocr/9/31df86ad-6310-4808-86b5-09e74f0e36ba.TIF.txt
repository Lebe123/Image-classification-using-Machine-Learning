Autopsy findings
link women’s
lung cancer rise
to alert diagnosis

WASHINGTON—Three Yale epidemiologists suggest that
‘women's higher incidence of lung cancer today may be
more a reflection of physicians’ diligence in diagnosing
it among women who smoke than of the increase in the
number of female smokers. But a pulmonary specialist
describes their hypothesis as “convoluted reasoning.”

‘The investigators base their theory on the “surprise
discovery." ina 10%-year autopsy review, of nearly equal
numbers of men and women with undiagnosed primary
Jung cancer. All 3286 autopsies performed on adult
patients at Yale-New Haven Hospital between Septem:
ber 1971 and May 1982 were included in the study.

Dr. Michael J. McFarlane, a Robert Wood Johnson
postdoctoral fellow, presented his group's findings at the
meeting here of the Association of American Physicians,
the American Society for Clinical Investigation, and the
American Federation for Clinical Research,

‘Small sample. Acknowledging thatthe sample size was
too small for the findings to achieve statistical signifi-
cance, Dr. McFarlane—speaking also for co-investigators
Drs. Alvan R. Feinstein and Carolyn K. Wells—said, “We
‘elieve that some ofthe recently feported increase in hung.
cancer in women may be due to increased detection and
that the increased detection may be enhanced by the in-
creased number of women who smoke.”

Primary lung cancer was found in 152 patients at au-
topss, including 108 whose cancers were diagnosed dur-
ing life and 43 whose tumors went undetected. Of those

   

 

 

with diagnosed lung cancer, 77 were men and 32 were
‘women aratio consistent with the expected hung cancer
incidence differential between men and women. Of those
with previously undiagnosed hung cancer, 24 were men—
for a lung cancer rate of 14.3 per 1,000—and 19 were
swomen-—for a rate of 12.7 per 1,000.

Of the 43 unexpected auropey reculte, 27 concerned
patients who had never had a cancer diagnosis and 16 con
‘cerned cancer patients with unknown or incorrectly iden:
tified primary sites. “Our findings clearly contrast the
reported rates of hing cancer diagnosed in men and
‘women during life. We can assume that a great deal of
lung cancer goes undetected among the general popula.
tion, especially among women,” Dr. McFarlane said
