BOSTON (AP) - Researchers announced they found the first direct
evidence that fetuses of women who smoke actually metabolize
cancer-causing agents contained in tobacco.

The study goes beyond what scientists have known for years ~
‘that smoking by pregnant women causes babies to be bom smnaller,
sicklier, at @ higher risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and - in
some cases - even addicted to nicotine.

The study, conducted by University of Minnesota professor
Stephen S. Hecht and sponsored by the National Cancer Institute,
‘examined the first urine produced by 48 German newborns. It was
presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Chemical
Society in Boston.

With the same equipment used to conduct sophisticated drug tests
on athletes, scientists searched for traces of the chemical NNK -
nicotine-derived nitrosaminoketone - one of the strongest
cancer-causing agents found in all types of tobacco products.

Previous studies have shown a relationship between NNK and lung
cancer in humans, as well as tumors in mice, rats and hamsters.
Experiments also have shown that NNK is a "statistically
significant" cause of tumors in the offspring of pregnant hamsters
and mice given the chemical, Hecht said

While researchers found no traces of NNK in newborns of
non-smokers, they detected the carcinogen in 22 of 31 newborns of
mothers who smoked during pregnancy

The pregnant women in the two-year study smoked between 5 and 25
cigarettes per day, averaging 12 cigarettes per day. Results showed
that NNK crosses the placental barrier between mother and fetus,
where it is then broken down by the fetus and expelled in its
urine, Hecht said
Hopefully this will deliver the message one more time about
how dangerous it is for pregnant women to smoke,” Hecht said
Sunday, a day before he was to formally present the study to the
society, which represents more than 150,000 scientists worldwide

Hecht said more research is needed to determine the likelihood
of the NNK leading to cancer in the newborns later in life, Because
‘most mothers who smoke during pregnancy will continue to smoke
