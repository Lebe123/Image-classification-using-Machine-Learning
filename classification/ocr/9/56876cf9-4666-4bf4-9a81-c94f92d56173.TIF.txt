Today, Basic is the second best-seller among PM's brands, behind
Marlboro, outselling most of its less expensive rivals in the discount

category. Its share is an impressive 4.7%.

"When we relaunched Basic we decided we would do what Philip

“Rather than competing on price only, we believed we could

strengthen the brand by differentiating it.”

company enhanced the brand's once-plain packaging with color and

stripes, boosted distribution and increased retail visibility.
