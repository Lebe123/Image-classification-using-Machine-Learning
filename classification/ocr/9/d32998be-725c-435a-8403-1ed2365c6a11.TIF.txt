‘The Federal Communication Com-
mission's proposal to ban cigarette
advertising on radio and television
is one of the most dangerous sug-

gestions to come out of a
‘Washington bureau in years.

THIS ABSURD move is based on
the FCC's assertion that smoking
is “a most serious, unique danger
to public health.” Obviously, six of
the seven members of the Com-
mission have accepted as a fact a
highly controversial report. The
Commission points to statistics of
the U. S. Department of Health,
Education and Welfare which blame
smoking for the deaths of many
Americans. These statistics have
been challenged since the time they
were issued. But this is not the
major aspect of the deplorable pro-
posel by the FCC. What it wants
is to compromise the principle of
free speech, as represented by
advertising and, in doing so, en-
courage the restraint of legitimate
trade,

‘The point we wish to emphasize
is simply. this: Commodities or
articles which are Jegal in the eyes
of tho laws of our Republic — and
rettes certainly are legal —
should not be subjected to any
restraint as to their advertising in

any form their makers wish.”

After all, the principle the FCC
{s following as to cigarettes could
be applied to many othiér products,
And if and when it is applied, then
advertising — one of the major
assets of the free enterprise system
= would be entirely under the con.
trol of bureaucrats and politicians,

Thus, when one looks ahead, the
danger of the FCC proposal is
magnified greatly.

CHAIRMAN HYDE has said he
4s confident his agency will have
the legal authority to enforce a
Cigarette advertising ban when the
1965 Cigarette Labeling and
Advertising act expires on July 1,
Under this law, both the FCC and
the Federal Trade Commission are
prohibited from taking any action
to regulate cigarette advertising.

Expecting a full congressional
review of the smoking controversy
after July 1, Mr. Hyde said “it is
a matter in’ which Congress will
be the final arbitor,

When the time comes for
Congress to make its decision, its
answer would be a wholehearted
and emphatic “No!” to the latest
FCC proposal. Otherwise American
freedom of speech and free en-
terprise will suffer one of the most
serious setbacks in modern times,
