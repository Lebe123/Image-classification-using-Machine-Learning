7-— WHICH SIDE ARE YOU ON?

Should Teenagers
Start Smoking?

To smoke or not to smoke? That’s the question many people
are asking themselves these days. They know it might be a
matter of life and death to them. And it's no secret that some
of these people aren't any older than you. Our information
for the “No” side was obtained by interviewing a man who
quit smoking three years ago after puffing two packs a day
for 15 years. We couldn't think of any arguments for the
“Yes” side. Can you? Which side are you on?

"The fun and pleasure of

‘not smoking far outweigh
the pleasure of two packs @

day. The non-smoker enjoys food

so much more. He has more en-

ergy to do things that are much

more satisfying than puffing a

weed. He sleeps more soundly.

‘He usually doesn’t catch as many

‘colds. He doesn’t get winded as

easily and so can do better in

sports, Usually he doesn’t annoy

himself and others with a rasp-

ing cough. In the. morning his

mouth does not taste like the in-

side of an old pair of gloves. He

is calmer, more poised, more con-

fident than many smokers.

‘The non-smoker saves money
—as much as $200 a year!

‘And don’t forget that a mere
two or three cigarettes a day fre-
quently lead to two or three
packs a day.

‘But there is a much more ser-
ious reason for not smoking cig-
arettes.

‘They can kill you.

No victim of the stabbing pain
of lung cancer would be likely to
advise you to smoke, The smoker
‘also has more reason to fear
heart attacks and diseases that
attack the lungs such as bron-
chitis and emphysema. The death
rate for men who began smok-
ing when they were teenagers is
100 percent higher than that of
non-smokers.

°As a non-smoker you can hope
for a longer life filled with the
real pleasures of not smoking.
‘And your growing confidence
and poise will spring, not from
‘the flimsy crutch of nicotine, but
from you.
