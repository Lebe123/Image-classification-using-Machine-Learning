Along with expansion in equipment,
the operators generally reported in-
creases in total pack volume over the
past five-year period. Among 23 oper
ators. giving estimates for both cur-
rent and five-year-ago volume, the
overall totals were: currently —5.684.-
562 million packs a month, or 247,155
monthly packs per operation; vs, five

Per-Unit Sales

To get an idea of consumer cig
arette buying trends in the past five
years, the operators were asked for
average monthly: per-machine pack
volume comparisons covering the pe-
fod. Some. 16 operators reported
gains here, with the average increase

sinst 1963 at the 6 per cent level,
13 said their sales fell off, with the
average amounting to 7 per cent, One

fon a per-machine unit basis. This is a
cigarette specialist—among many in
the city—with 90 per cent of its ma
cchines in. public locations carrying
prices of 50 and (mainly) 55 cents per
pack, vs. standard counter pricing of
48 cents and supermarket prices at $4
carton. The operation had 2,100 ma-
chines on location five years ago and
counts 1,900 today: its total monthly
tunit volume has fallen in that period
from 1.1 million packs to a current
rate of 800,000. This pretty well re-
flects the general nosedive for vended
cigarette sales in New York City,
caused mainly by a combination of
high. pack taxes ((taling over. 18
cents) and large-scale bootlegging.
