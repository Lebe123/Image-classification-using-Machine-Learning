SMOKING AND HEALTH TO BE
SUBJECT OF STATE COUNCIL

Several Oklahoma agencies and
institutions are now involved in the
reparation of a unique educational
rogram on smoking and health
The program is aimed at the school
teacher, and is designed to provide
the educator with the needed iafor-
mation and materials on smoking
and health.

* Cooperating in this effort are the
Oblshoma taterageneyxCouncil oo

‘Srpoking and Health, the University
of Oklahoma College of Continuing
Education, the Extension Division
Of the University of Oklahoma, the
Department of Preventive Medicine
‘and Public Health at the Univer-
sity of Otlaboma Medical School,
‘and the Otlaboma Television Au-
thority, and the U. S. Public Heaith
Service. ‘These ‘groups trave deve-
Joped a teacher training course in
‘smoking and health which is to be-
gin next week. The program is to
De tested in Mustogee County.

‘A course in smoking and health,
designed especially for educators,
willbe offered by the University
of Oklahoma College of Continuing
Education. It will utilize directed
readings, educational television, for-
‘mal lectures, and classcoom dis
cussion. ‘Two hours of college credit
will be given for the course.

“It is hoped," states Mrs. Sharon
. Ferguson, Coordinator of the Inter~
agency Council on Smoking and
Health, “that this pilot study might
light the way to effective educa-
tonal methods in all health areas,
pot only in smoking aid health. The
entire course was designed with the
teacher in mind. We understand
that the teacher often cannot de-
vote more time to the teaching of
‘smoking and health, so we hope to
assist them to use the time they
have more effectively.”
