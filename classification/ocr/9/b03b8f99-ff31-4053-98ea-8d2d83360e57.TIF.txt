CIGARETTES ON
UP-BEAT AGAIN

‘The relationship between cigarette
smoking and lung cancer is as ob-
scure as before the big storm blew
up over a year ago, according to Dr,
Clarence Cook Little, chairman of
the scientific advisory board of the
‘Tobacco Research Industry Commlt-
tee. Since there are so many pos
sible causes of cancer, it Is pos
sible that no one element, such as
‘Some found in cigarettes, might ever
be blamed as a positive, unfailing
cause. As far as the American pub-
Uc is concerned, It seems to concur
because cigarette sales have partial-
ly retaken the helghts they had a.
couple of years ago. Like anybody
who isn’t sure, but is willing to be
cautious, a large segment of the
population has shifted to fitertip
cigarettes. In the long drive by the
cigarette manufacturers to regain
their position against the orlginal
“moral’”-medical attack on smokin
promotion of all types has played a
major part. Originally only one side
was heard from and the cigarette
makers were in a disorganized re-
treat, the public had to go alongwith
‘medical opinion. As soon as the
positive voice of “maybe, but no
fone really knows" wan heard, then
the public started to look’ more
closely at the situation. Also,
peoples" habits are pernicious; they
may oe subdued, but they are never
really eradicated. Effective promo-
ton brought home to people the post-
tive element of doubt, positive from
the viewpoint of the cigarette
people, because even Dr. Little
pointe out that no one knows as yet.

A bit of proof for special situa
tions that sometimes a quick retort
can be worse than the temporary no
defense at all. The cigarette people
took too long @ time to make up their
minds, but the element thot bas
worked, based on medical facts, is
“no one really knows.”
