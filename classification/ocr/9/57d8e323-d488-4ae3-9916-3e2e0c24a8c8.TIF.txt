WASHINGTON (AP) - The tobacce industry, which manufactures billions of
cigarettes a year, said Tuesday it wants to keep children from lighting up.

‘SwWe want to protect children from making decisions that they are not
capable of,’' Tobacco Institute vice president Brennan M. Dawson said at 4 news
Jonference announcing a campaign to keep cigarettes away from anyone under 18+

 

“oT a child never picks up anether cigarette it would be fine with the
tebacco industry, ’’ Dawson said.

But anti-smoking groups immediately attacked the industry announcement 3
hypocritical.

 

‘The ... campaign is little more than a clever smoke screen designed more
for publicity than to effectively discourage tobacco us@ among our nation s
young people,’‘ said Fran Du Melle of the American Lung Association.

Dawson said the campaign would support state laws limiting cigarette sales
to adults and would put new limitations on billboard and other tobacco
advertising and dstribute a parent’s guide on how to discourage children from
smoking.

 

However, she said the guidelines won’t prevent cigarette companies ftom
cantinuing ta sponsor sporting events, such as tennis tournaments.

Dawson said she didn’t know the cost of the program, but said it was
**millions of dollars.'’

Du Melle, whe represented a coalition that includes the American Heart
Association and the American Cancer Society, called the Tobacco Institute
program °° just another public relations effort to head off congressional
congideration of meaningful and effective legislation to regulate what has
proven itself to be an irresponsible industry.“

Ghe said the industry action would not curtail marketing tactics targeted at
children.

    

Once again, the tobacco industry seeks to mislead the oublic about i
intentions by putting forward a package of reforms which don’t go Tar enough te
have a meaningful impact,’’ Du Melle said. °*These proposals can’t withstand
the most minimal scrutiny.‘ ’

  

Another anti-smoking group, Action on Smoking Or Health, said there already
are local government efforts under way ‘to curtain sales of cigarettes to minors
and that the tobacco industry campaign **is simply making a virtue of
necessity. “°

‘32 don’t think anything the tobacco industry does will ever satisty our
critics,’’ Dawson said when asked if the industry was trying to avoid federal
Legislation.

 

The campaign was kicked off at a news conference that included educators who
said they endorsed the effort. The educators also said they were being oaid tor
their appearance.
