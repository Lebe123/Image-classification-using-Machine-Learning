Warning added as Clinton
hints at tobacco crackdown *

By Harry Berkowitz

‘The politically hot issue of cigarette smoking by
youngsters took center stage yesterday not ony in the
political corridors of Washington, D.C., but at a Phil
‘Morris plant in Richmond, Va. 7 °°" ~

fm Washington, the White House indicated that!
within days, President Bill Clinton may announee'
new measures to clamp down on the marketing and |
sale of cigarettes to youngsters.

Also, National Public Radio aired a Monday inter-
view in which Clinton said the nation needs a “tough,
and mandatory” program to reduce smoking by teens'
and preteens.

‘Meanwhile, Philip Morris, the nation’s biggest |
cigarette maker, gathered reporters and. photogta-|
phers at its Richmond plant as it started to stamp:
"Underage Sale Prohibited” on one side of Marlboro,
Light packs. a

‘The message, which will be on all of its brands by’
-year's end, is part of a program of voluntary measures’
‘and suggested legislation that the company announced
in June to make it harder for youngsters to gain access
to cigarettes. The company — focusing on access rath.
er than advertising — also has stopped giving out and,
railing free samples to people and is supporting great-i} ,
er supervision of cigarette vending machines.

But crities said such steps have not been effectively
enforced in the past and are public relations ploye |
‘meant to avoid harsher restrictions.

“t's far too little and it’s far too late,” said Scott,
Ballin, director of the Coalition for Smoking or Health‘|
in Washington, D.C. “When faced with possible regul
tions, the industry will give an inch to gain a decade.’

‘The critics say money spent on youth anti-smoking”
‘programs pales in comparison to the billions of dollars.
‘companies spend each year on advertising and promot
ing cigarettes with such images as the Marlboro co\
boy, hip Joe Camel and happy Newport couples.
