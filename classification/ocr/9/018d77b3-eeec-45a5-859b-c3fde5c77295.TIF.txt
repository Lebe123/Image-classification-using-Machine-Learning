© Statistician Takes Dim View
Of Smoking-Cancer Figures

 

By Robert S. Kleckner

“A doctor at Mayo Clini
whom the Cancer Bulletin’
terms the dean of American’
‘medical statisticians ‘has cast
doubt on assertions that cigaret|
‘amoking can be pinpointed as
the cause of lung cancer,

Despite the docto's asser-
tions, the American Cancer So-
ciety’ has insisted that cigarets
apparently are one cause of
Jung cancer and many physi

clams agree.

‘were published in the bulletin,

‘Atmosphere Of Emetion’

‘The bulletin is published by
the University of Texas M. D.
‘Anderson Hospital and Tumor
Clinic, Houston. On its medi-
‘al advisory board are such can-

“The whole discussion (ofthe

Dr. Berkson continued:
“Maybe the reason scientists
general are not trying to
find the cause of lung cancer

tobacco smoke is that they
‘don’t really believe it contains
the cause.”

Total Deaths Decline

He suggested there had been
about as much lung cancer in
the past but that it had not
‘been recognized. Dr. Berkson
added:

“While the reported death
ate from lung cancer has been
increasing, the total death rate
from all causes has not been
increasing, but, instead, has
been decreasing.

“The reported rise of the
death rate from lung cancer
can be questioned because of
the inaccuracy in the past in
stating this cause of death on
[death certificates”

Dr. Berkson wrote that while
the death rates from all causes
were greater among smokers in
the statistics from the popula-
tion studied, these segments
neither were defined nor se-
lected at random,

“The studies," he said, “were
‘made on the men who answered
the questionnaires. I. showed
mathematically long ago that,
in such selected samples, just
such statistical associations as|
were fousd in these inquiris|
might appear, but do not exist

 

 

in the populations themselves."
‘Huge Blunders?

He asserted it “is no seciet
that huge blunders have been
made with the uncritical use of
statistics

‘A. nonsmoker, Dr. Berkson
wrote:

“The public has been. made|
cigaret conscious by this dis-
cussion as it never has been
before, and cigaret sales have
‘mounted. The tobacco industry
and those who own tobacco |
stock, of whom, unhappily 1
fam not one, have benefitted,
But has anyone else?”

Meanwhile, Chicago Medi-

cine, the official pubiicauon ot
the Chicago Medical Society,
said editorially that more and
‘more hospitals in this area have
eliminated cigaret vending ma-
Jchines. It added: “We can be-
