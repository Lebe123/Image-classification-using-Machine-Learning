Please quit

Tomorrow, the American Cancer Society is asking
the nation’s 55 million smokers to quit for a day during
the fifth annual Great American Smokeout, and we
‘would like to butt in and add our plea.

Volunteers have given smokers pledge cards and will
‘check back with them after the day. One ofthe local ac-
tivities willbe free lung testing at Loma Linda Univer-
sity. Last year, 49 percent made it through one day; 13,
percent stayed ‘cold turkey” for three months; 10 per-
cent were clean for six months, and 6.7 percent still
weren’t smoking more than 11 months later.

‘This meant the Great American Smokeout was the
impetus for more than a million Americans to per-
manently quit smoking.

‘And because there is no doubt there is a definite link
between smoking and lung cancer, and a definite link
between lung cancer and death, the smokeout is a good
Idea.

‘According to the Cancer Society, cigarette smoking is
the cause of 80,000 deaths each year from lung cancer,
and it contributes to the 22,000 deaths from other
cancers; 225,000 deaths from heart disease and stroke;
‘and 19,000 deaths from chronic lung disease.

‘Across this page, Andy Rooney has written an ex-
cellent column about how advertising makes smoking,
this deadly habit, seem virile, beautiful and seductive,
‘We doon’t need to duplicate what he has already said,
as there are enough other things about tomorrow's”
Great American Smokeout and smoking to talk about.

It seems as though the smokeout is one of those a
tivities no one could attack — kind of like Thanksgiving.
— because there's nothing wrong with helping people,
quit. _

But William D. Toohey, a spokesman for the Tobacco
Institute in Washington, D.C., said, “It's obviously a
‘great publicity tool for the Cancer Society as they move
Into their fund-raising season,

“But we think it's really a shame that they spend
millions of dollars on this one-day media event when
that money could be put toward scientific research to
determine exactly how and why a normal healthy cell
becomes cancerous. Those questions still remain
unanswered and are, I think, of utmost importance to
all ofus.””

So we called Mr. Toohey and asked him if he smokes.
He said, “I do, and I won't be joining the smokeout
because I enjoy it.”

‘Mr. Toohey may find out how some “normal healthy
cells become cancerous,” if his physician ever tells him
‘his smoking has given him lung cancer.

‘There are two ways to fight cancer — find how how to
stop it and find out what causes it.

‘They are equally important and the Cancer Society is:
workingon both.

It is ridiculous to only try and cure people when you
already know how to prevent their disease.

But this is what the Tobacco Institute wants,

‘And with or without the Great American Smokeout,
they are seemingly getting their way. With all that
advertising, 690 billion cigarettes were consumed in
1980, up 10 billion from the previous year. :

‘The number of teenage girls who smoke a pack or
more of cigarettes a day has quadrupled between 1964
and 1975. An estimated six million Americans under age,
‘20smoke, 100,000 of them 12 years old or younger. .

‘Too many people are getting the wrong message —
that smoking is mature, virile, tough, macho, beautiful.

‘The Great American Smokeout, in spite of all the pro-
paganda from groups like the Tobacco Institute, is get-
ting out the right message. Now if only the smokers will
