Wd

new anti-tobacco
legislative Proposal

 

Underscoring its commitment to
the area’s top cash crop, the Pitt-
sylvania County Board of Supecvi-
sors adopted a resolution Monday
night opposing new anti-tobacco
efforts being considered by
Congress.

‘The measure, approved unani-
monaly, will be sent to other
acco-producing counties in Vi
Binia and North Carolina in hopes
of enlisting their support as well,
‘said Chatham Supervisor Roy Byrd
‘ty the board's chairman,

Copies will also go to Sth Dis-
trict Representative LIP. Payne Ji.
‘and US, Seaatort John Warmer and
‘Charles Robb.

The issue was brought to the

  

county's attention by Calvin Neal, ing

‘a former Dan River District super-
visor who serves on a special agri-
‘cultural advisory committee ap-
pointed by Payne,

Other local committee members
include Blairs Supervisor Edwin
Shields, a Dry Fork tobacco farmer:
Tunstall Supervisor F.A. Keats,
who has a cattle operation in
Brosville: and Elliott McCormick,
a Java tobacco farmer and forme
‘member of the board of supervisors.

‘Tough anti-tobacco legislation
has been introduced by U.S. Sea.
Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts
and U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman of

 

ened, which tas already

- passed a Senate committee, caries &

price tag of $110 million, including
‘$50 million for an annual anti-
smuoking advertising campaign.

Tn addition, a new agency would
‘be created under the Health and
Haman Services Department 10
avard $25 million in grants each
year for new anti-smoking pro-
‘grams.

‘Tobacco products would be re-

red | new addiction
th, and warning labels wodkd Be
required to covet 20 percent of the
front and back of cigareue packs.

‘According to the tobacco indus-
try, their product would be placed in
the same category as hard drugs in
deugefree schools programs, and
lawsuits could be brought against
retailers and distributors for violst-
the new law.

"They just keep beating tobacco
to death,” said Neal, who became
interested in the legislation after
hearing an announcement at a
Danville wobaceo warehouse,

“To keep throwing taxpayers’
‘money away on antissmoking ef-
forts..t just think the money could
be beiter used for education, build-
ing roads, and other thing.” he
sid.

By far the county's largest cash
srop, tobacco rang up $38 million
in sales last year, moré than double
all other crops and livestock com-

bined.
