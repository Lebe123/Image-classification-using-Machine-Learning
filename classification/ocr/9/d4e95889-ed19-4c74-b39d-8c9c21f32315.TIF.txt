growing tendency to branch out into
non-tobacco enterprises

HE R. J. Reynolds Tobacco
Company, the biggest cigarette
maker of the U.S., announced

recently that it hat acquired Pacific
Havaiian Products Co, a maker of
cake mixes, fruit beverages and shoe-
shine kits. Behind this move and other
cigarette makers’ expansion of their
rnon-tobacco activities are, according to
the opinion of several financial analysts,
some disquieting statistics,

In 1962 the annual increase of
cigarette consumption was the smallest
since 1954. According to estimates,
per-capita consumption has remained
at the same level as in 1961. This
contrasts with an average growth rate
fof approximately 3} packs a person
‘each year from 1957 through 1961.

Industrial observers claim that with
this move another episode has been
closed in the struggle of the U.S.
tobscco industry to combat adverse
publicity linking cigarette smoking
with lung cancer and other diseases:

Although it has been pointed out
that Reynolds’ would probably hesitate
to connect its diversification programme
with fear for the smoking habit, it has
been claimed that over the past Year or
40, and not least tince the publication
in March, 1962, of the unfavourable
British report on “Smoking and
Health”, evidence has been mounting
in the U.S. against cigarette smoking
as a health hazard,

In June, 1954, the American Cancer
Society published a study showing
certain statistical correlations between
smoking and lung cancer. This was
taken up by the popular Press and
for the first time a “cancer scare”
ensued which was reflected in a decline
jn smoking that year.

In the meantime the American
public has repeatedly been exposed to
the question of the relationship between
Gigarette smoking and lung cancers
1 few weeks ago the public once again
hhas been confused by conflicting

Society and the Tobacco Institute,
the organisation of the U.S. tobacco
industry, which through its ‘Tobacco
Research: Committee sponsors a pro-
‘gramme of research into questions of
Tobacco use and health. So. far
$6,250,000 have been appropriated
for this purpose.

However, the Surgeon General of
the United States last October appoin-
ted a committee of leading scientists in
order to obtain “a comprehensive
review ofall available data on smoking
and other factors in the environment
that may affect health”; intimating that
the public should wait until the
committee presents its findings, prob-
ably this summer.

In 1929 Reynolds bought for a very
modest. sum’ the Tin-Foil Rolling
Company, now the Archer Aluminum
Division. This division supplies vireu-
ally all Reynolds’ foil. requirements
and performs all the foil and paper
colour printing. Ic sells its surplus to
third parties, both inside and outside
the industry. Indeed the company
believes itis an important factor in the
foil market

During the last 10 years or so the
use of aluminium foil for frozen food,
for broiling and many other cooking
and household purposes in the U.S.
thas increased at a rapid rate. The main
‘outlets—food stores and supermarkets
‘sell packaged aluminium fol in large
amounts; Reynolds has secured a
sizeable shate of this market, In 1958,
185,511 short tons of aluminium fol
valued at $140.5 million have been,
shipped. In 1960 the value of ship-
ments rose to $179.4 million. The 1961
production of the entire U.S. foilgy
industry amounted to $187.7 million.

‘To meet the increased demandty
Archer Aluminum Division is presently
expanding the capacity of the factory
by so per cent. Reynolds hopes t0
increase its proportion of sales to
outside customers, now about 25 per
cent.

 

 

Philip Morris Inc. acquired Milprint
Inc., a leading convertor of flexible
packaging; a subsidiary, the Nicolet
Paper Company, nicely rounded out of
the line of packaging material, Sales
‘of Milprint and its subsidiary, Nicolet
Paper Company, increased considerably
last year; in order to meet the increased
demand for its specialty papers, Nicolet
last November started an expansion

production of top grade merchandise.

Philip Morris acquired Polymer
Industries, Inc., a producer of synthetic
resin emulsions. ‘This company will
build a new, modern reactor plant for
the production of emulsion polymers
on a 27-acre site near Greenville
(North Carolina). This new facility,
scheduled for completion late this yeat,
reflects the growing demand for many
textile yarn preparation and fin'shing
products; it points to the growing
position of the company in the produc-
tion of textile chemicals

R. J. Reynolds installed the Hunter
‘continuous casting process, whereby
4 in. aluminium sheet is’ produced
directly from molten metal and rolled
down into foil immediately, Further
[progress in the functional uses of foil—
plain, aminated or coloured—have
‘been made. ‘The operations are now
integrated with the installation of the
latest laminating, foil and paper colour
printing and roto-gravure presses down,
to the final product. As a, result,
Reynolds is already selling packaging
material to many more industries at an
increasing rate.
