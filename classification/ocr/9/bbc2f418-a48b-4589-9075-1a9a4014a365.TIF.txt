1 Introduction

‘The hazardous health effects of sctive smoking have been well documented
throughout the years, Attention later focused on the effects on the nonsmaker exposed
to tobacco smoke, Two reports rom the United States Surgeon General on smoking
and health, published in 1975! and 1979, were amongst the first official scientific
reports to address the issue of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, also referred
‘os involuntary smoking’ or ‘passive stoking’. The reports, whilst not establishing a
causal link with diseases such as cancer o¢ heart disease, concluded that pass
smoking was a health concern and that research wes needed to quantify the effects.
‘Two years later, in 1981, the first three epidemiological studies* were published
which assessed the effect of passive smoking on the risk of lung cancer in nonsmoking
women with husbands who smoked. One was a large cohort study from Japan’ and
another was a case-contrul study from Greece,* both reported a statistically significant
imcreased risk of lung cancer. The third study was a cohort study from the American
Cancer Society’ in which the author concluded that there was lite or no excess
associated with exposure to tobacco smoke, as although an increased risk was found it
was not statistically significant
