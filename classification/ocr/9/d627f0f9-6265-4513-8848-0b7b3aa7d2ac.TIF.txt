Smoking And Cancer

theses have beon found wanting. Dr, Little
4a true scientist and no one for a moment,
could suspect that a man of his calibre
would lend himself to anything but a
thorough and impartial development of
selentifie facts, The industry research or~
ganization has been given a half million
dollars to spend and Dr, Little has been
‘given full selentife freedom in the conduct
of hhis investigation and permission to let
‘the chips fall where they may."

‘Some might call the manufacturers’ in~
terest a self-serving interest, with millions
of dollars at stake. Tt 1s, of course, just
that—but certainly a legitimate self-serv-
ing interest,

‘Thus far the statements made by au-
thorities, while conficting, have boon suf-
flclent to raise question about whether
smoking causes cancer but no conclusive
evidence has been offered and the opinions
of one expert has been counterbalanced by
the contrary opinion of another.

‘If—and this is not prejudicial—there is
some element in cigarette smoking which
‘causes or contributes to lung eancer, then
it may be possible to find and remove this
element, It would also be a gource of great
veassurance to the smokers who have
neither the hardihood to quit nor the in-
difference to keep them ftom worrying.

‘Meanwhile, until selence supplies the
answer, lay theories can serve no useful
Purpose. One of them may be right, but as
of the moment It cannot be backed up by
selentife facts,
