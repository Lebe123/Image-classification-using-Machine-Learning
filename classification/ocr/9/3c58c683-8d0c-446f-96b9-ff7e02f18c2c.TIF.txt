decision was nearautomati.
Casteo-Neves had learned the
‘Thursday before that season
finale that Hogan Racing, previ
ously funded by over Carl
Hogan without primary spon
rorship, would be closing shop.

 

  

 

 

  

 

"To be honest," Castro-Ne-
vves said, “I was the last one to
know that Carl was shutting
down. It was a nightmare,
like everything got darker, like
in the movies.”

Hogan previously had exer-
ised an option to retain Cas-
tro-Neves at a time when he
‘thought a 2000 sponsorship
deal was imminent and after
several teams had expressed
interest in his driver.

‘Thus was Castro-Neves
available, “I didn't have any-
thing," he said, “and then T have
a great opportunity. It's really
unfortunate the way it came.
But I believe everybody under-
stands”

All he can do, he said, is
attempt to make the most of it.

Twill come as more of asur-
prise if Castro-Neves doesn't
achieve an inaugural victory
this year than if he does. He
