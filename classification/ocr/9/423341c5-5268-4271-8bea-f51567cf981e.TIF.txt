Tobacco ads ,,
Let them be; fight smoking in other ways

‘lthoueh fe thing nhl wold have
entrely negative value, fobacea comes
close, With the significant exception of
its religous importance to American
Indians, tabscco looms mostly as a
death-dealing, resourcesabsorbing
scourge that the world and its people
would be better without,

Getting to a id, howev-
er, will requite enormous effort from a
lot of people. In thelr passion againat
smoking, the young people of Brooklyn
Center and their mayor, Todd Paulson,
clearly ae on the side ofthe angels, But
they've chosen an unfortunate and dive
criminstory taetic for advancing their
agenda,

   

Paulton is pushing a clty ordinance that
‘would probibit most tobacco advertis-
dng in stores and ter plat where
tabasco products are sold, This week he
received qubstantinl encouragement
ffom the youngters at Evergreen Park
Elementary School, where 105820 d+
Vertisng has been a subject of study for
‘itth-graders,

Paulson got another boost for his ordi-
nance, which comes before the Brook
lyn Center City Council Monday night,
when researchers reported this week
that the sumber of young smokers bas
risen each year since 1988 — following
a IS-year decline, The research suggests
4 strong link between introduction ot
the Jc toon character and the
upsurge in teenage smoking.

RB ‘obgeg0 of course denies

utly that cigarettes didn’t cause tung:
cancer, contribute to beart disease or
have any ofthe other detrimental lth
effegs that decades of hard science now

attributes to them.

 
 
  

ig, number of young
nd with Joe Carel at
plicated in the inerease, why not
bap inatore advertising? Because tt cuts
too close to important First Amend
ment freedoms enshrined fa the US.
Constitution, T's legal to make cigae
Fettes, legal to sell them to adults, legal
to smoke them and legal to advertise
thern in many public and private places.

Given all of thit, Brooklya Center
should not — and’ probably would be
told by the courts that it carat —
roll owners of privase busneses

Tadeed, the only way to justify euch 1
prvate-property prohibition on adver-
tising most likely would involve a ne-
tonal law making the sale and noneeli-
lous use of tobacco products illegal and
prohibiting all forms of advertising for
them, Stong arguments can be ad-
vanced that Congress should ta

one Congress it likely to embrace any

‘Until it does, Paulson and the young
folk of Brooklyn Center ahould focut
their commendable antismoking pas-
sion on the many other ways that tobac-
co use, particularly by young people,
ean be discouraged.
