from the PM workforce to participate in the Salvation Army Kettle Program. Ninety
employees donated a total of 98.5 hours of personal time to this project. Monty
Matthews, Manager of Primary Processing, is a member of the Advisory Board for the
Salvation Army.

Church of God Orphanage

For the past three years, the Philip Morris Cabarrus Expansion Project Team and Fluor
Daniel employees have sponsored "Operation Our Kids." This is in support of the
Cabarrus County Church of God Orphanage, Each month project team members have
provided a birthday party for the children at the orphanage. This party was complete with
birthday presents selected for each child, a decorated birthday cake, ice cream, soft drinks
and balloons. Project team members took the party supplies to the orphanage every
month and celebrated with all the children. During the three years, they also provided
money to pay for a chartered bus for the kids and house parents to travel to Disney World;
renovated condemned playground equipment; and shared picnics with the house parents
and children, For Christmas, gifts were provided for all the children as well as special
presents for the entire home such as encyclopedias, CD Rom games and educational
software,

With the "winding down" of the Cabarrus Expansion project, they will not be having
birthday parties in 1995. On Tuesday, December 13, members of the project team took
their last gifts to the orphanage. They presented staff members and maintenance personnel
at the home with potted plants; house parents and staff were given gift certificates; and the
home was presented a check for $1200 to use toward whatever they deemed necessary.
