Proposition 200 this spring,

‘anti-smoking advocates assured
Skittish business owners they had
nothing to fear, that tough restrictions
in other cities had not hurt the bottom
line. Now that the ordinance is in
effect, the City Council should
carefully monitor the situation to see
that the assurances match reality.

Some business owners are
predicting they'll face severe
hardships unless exempted from the
ordinance, which is one of the
toughest and most comprehensive in
the nation. Nearly all businesses,
‘workplaces and public places,
including | building entrances, must be
kept smoke-free. Even bars that are
exempted from the ordinance must
physically isolate smokers so
second-hand smoke won't waft into
nonsmoking areas.

‘Owners of some restaurants, pool
halls, coffee shops and other
businesses that catered to
smokers are predicting they'll lose
customers to neighboring cities.
‘They've pleaded with the City Council
to provide variances so they can stay

in business.
"So far, the council prudently has
opted to make only minor changes in
the law. Nothing sparks the wrath of
voters — even when tumout is a
piddling 15 percent — quicker than
officials appearing to negate election
results.

‘Doomsayers may also be
overstating their case. A study two
years ago of 15 western cities that
adopted tough anti-smoking
ordinances found no effect on.
restaurant revenues. Conducted by
University of California's Institute for
Health Policy Studies, the study
focused mainly on cities within urban
areas, similar to the Valley, as well as
on several in isolated settings.

But that doesn't guarantee there
won't be exceptions here. And any
business that suffers a sudden,
significant drop in business because of
the ordinance deserves the council's
attention.

‘No one should lose their ivetihood
to an ordinance that was sold as
business-friendly as well as
health-friendly.
