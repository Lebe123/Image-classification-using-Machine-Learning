INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES FACILITIES BECOME SMOKE-FREE

Tobacco, originally a Western Hemisphere plant, was used for ceremonies
by many American Indians, especially those on the Northern Plains, before the
Europeans arrived (1). Its current use by American Indians and Alaskan Natives
varies greatly. American Indians from the Southwest smoke very little tobacco,
whereas those from the Northern Plains and Alaskan Natives have substantially
higher smoking rates than the general U.S. population (Table 1). The mortality
rates due to smoking-related diseases in the areas served by the Indian Health
Service (IHS) correlate with the differences in smoking prevalence (Table 2).

The IHS, which is a component of the Health Resources and Services
Administration of the Public Health Service (PHS), has comprehensive
responsibilities for the health care of approximately 937,000 American Indians
and Alaskan Natives. Facilities include 45 hospitals with a total of 1,989ds
65 health centers, and many field clinics throughout the United States
American Indian/Alaskan Native groups also administer six hospitals and
numerous clinics through a federally funded tribal program under Public Law
93-638.

To reduce the health hazards of involuntary (passive) smoking and to
encourage nonsmoking behavior among American Indians and Alaskan Natives, the
IHS has established smoke-free environments in its facilities (8-10). These
efforts began on February 19, 1985, with a meeting between IHS representatives
and the Surgeon General of the United States to discuss plans for a "Smoke-Free
IHS."

To be considered smoke-free, an IHS facility must have no designated
smoking rooms for staff, patients, or visitors. In late 1983, the PHS Indian
Hospital on the Hopi Reservation at Keams Canyon, Arizona, became the first to
reach this goal (9). Now, virtually all IHS facilities have become smoke-free
In addition, this initiative led to a smoke-free policy in the American Indian
schools on the Navajo Reservation at Zuni, New Mexico

The IHS has taken steps to evaluate the impact of its policy on smoking
behavior. For example, results of a survey conducted in the Rapid City PHS
Indian Hospital in December 1985 suggest that daily cigarette consumption
decreased after implementation of a smoke-free policy.
