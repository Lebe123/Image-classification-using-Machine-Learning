Bourne board
changes part
of smoke ban

Lighting up in most eateries,

bars acceptable once again .y

By MARK MERCHANT
‘STAFF WAITER,

BOURNE —~ Just two months
after new smoking regulations i
‘Bourne went into effect, the board
of health voted Wednesday to
amend them, sparing bars and res-
taurants from the tougher rules.

Cut in a 3-2 vote were the regula-
tions that outlawed smoking in
bars and restaurants with more
than two employees by May 1,
2000.

The new regulations outlaw
smoking in other public buildings,
ban cigarette vending machines,
town, require businesses have a
town permit to sell tobacco, limit
where stores can display tobacco
products and forbid giveaways of
tobacco products. Those rules
stayed the same, except for an ad-
dition that prohibits smoking by
‘minors in restaurants.

‘The change pleased town res-
taurant owners while upsetting
those ‘who helped draft Bourne's
original regulations.

“Restaurant people take a big
risk and lay their money on the
line. To have a bureaucracy come
in and tell them they have to do
something that's going to hurt
their business, ckat's not right.”
said George Fianegan of Fimnie's
Place on MacArthur Boulevard.
“Atleast this will give the business-
mena fair shake”

Under the bar ban, anmual ex-
ceptions would have been allowed
if the smoking area of the restaur-
ant was no more than 20 percent of
the floor space and if the restaur-
ant had a ventilation system that
could move 60 cubic feet of air per

Holly O'Brien, Program Director
for the Cape Cod Regional Te-
bacco Control Program, called the
vote a grave disappointment and a
blow to public health progress. The
Tobacco Control Program and a
consortium of the boards of health
of Cape Cod, Wareham and Nan-
tucket created the original draft
regulations, which were then tal
‘en'back to the town health boar

for local modifications.

The defeat, she said, came in
because of a concerted effort
the tobacco industry to influ
tence the board’s opinion. O'Brien
provided copies of aie circulated
in Bourne before the meeting urg-
{ng people to turn out for the meet-
ing and “speak out" for their
rights.

The original regulations were
adopted when the board's mem-
bership had dwindled to three
members from the five members
that normally sit on the board —
enough for @ quorum. Since the
two-to-one vote, two new members
‘were elected to the board, bringing
the body up to full strength and
changing the majority.

‘The two new members, Michael
Giancola and John Harrington,
who authored Wednesday's
changes, both said they opposed
the regulations during their elec-
tion campaigns:

“They were one-issue candi-
dates and there's so much going on
with the health boards," O'Brien
said.

“T hope in two years we can go
back to the board of health and
‘convince the new members this is
dacsential for public health,” abe
