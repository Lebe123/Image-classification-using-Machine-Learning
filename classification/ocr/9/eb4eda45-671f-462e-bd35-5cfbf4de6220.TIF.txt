Alar Panic Shows Power of
Media to Trigger Fear

mHealth: ’60 Minutes’ broadcast created scare at
time when the industry was already moving away ~
from use of the chemical.

ByDAVID SHAW

‘The waring--uttered on prime-time. network television,
against’ backdrop: of gisnt'apple marked witha skull and
ctossbones—vias indeed ominous: "

"The most potent cancer-causing aget in’ out food supply
is a substance sprayed on apples to Keep them on the trees
longer and meke them look better.”

‘So said Ed Bradley on "60 Minutes" on Feb. 26, 1989, and
so began a nationwide panic, fed by other media, which quickly
followed "60 Minutes*’s lead with their own stories onthe Kill
cr chemical daminozide (beter known, by its trade name—
Ale).

‘Young children, the media, reported; were especially
“alnerabile;thecause they tended jo-driak alot of apple juice‘ad:
‘because their digestive and immune systems were not fully
developed.

‘But at the time ofthe "60 Minutes" broadcast—which was

 

‘The media coverage produced a nationwide hysteria.
School boards in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Atlanta
and many other cites banned apples and apple products from
their cafeterias. Some parents raced after their children’s school
buses to yank apples ftom their lunch boxes. Supermarkets
came under intense pressure to remove apples form their
shelves. Uniroyat, the manufacturer of Alar; pulled the product
off the market. Sales of apples plummeted, forcing many farm-
ex to dump their erops or ive them away—costing the industry
‘more than $100 million, according to economists’ estimates.

Reaction to the Alar scare "set a troubling precedent,” the
‘Washington Post editorialized several weeks later. “A com
cated scientific issuo was allowed to be decided not by officials
‘hare. with protecting. th public, on the-Basis:of Rar evi
<dence, bat bya fiightened pubic acting on incomplete and often
‘efroncous press reports."

“The EPA had expressed concern about the safety of Alar
for many years before Newsweek and "60 Minutes" jumped on
the story. But the agency had docided that test results were ei
ther flawed, contradictory or insufficiently conclusive to warrant
an immediste ban and formal action was delayed, pending hear
ings in late 1920,

viewed by an estimated 40 million Americens—industry was al-
ready moving away from Alar, and the nation's three major
‘baby-food makers said they were using non-Alsr apples.

‘The Natural Resources Defense Council, an activist en-
vironmental group, wanted the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency to ban Alar and several other pesticides. When the
‘group produced a report ("Iatolerable Risk: Pesticides in Our
Children’s Food") condemning Alar, Newsweek rushed into
print withthe story before the report was officially cleased,

‘The report, Newsweek said, would “almost certainly gen-
crate frightening headlines.”

Indeed it did—three weeks later, right after "60 Minutes"
aired its story. News media throughout the country—effectively
‘manipulated by-the Natural Resources Defense Council and aid~
ced by public appeals and congressional testimony from that
well-known molecular biologist Meryl Streep—almost made it
seem that one bite of an Alar-reated apple or one swig of juice
made from Alar-treated apples would mean instant deat,

‘Coverage of the Alar scare was “outrageous ... completely
alarmist," says Marla Cone, who writes about the environment
for the Los Angeles Times.

But Alar Was a made-to-order media story. It had apples,
ids and cancer. “A lot of (media) people were suckered in,”
Cone says.

 

 

Reporting,” says EPA and scientific criticism of Alar convinced
‘him the story was worth doing atthe time.

Dr. John A. Moore, then acting administrator of the EPA,
said on “60 Minutes” that Alar "should come off the market” be-
‘cause of what he had earlier described as “an inescapable and
direct correlation” between exposure to Alar and “the develop-
‘ment of life-threatening tumors."

The public had a right to know that was their view,"
Gelber says.

Al Meyérhoff, senior attorney for the Natural Resources
Defense Fund, also defends the Alar story

He says the apple industry launched a “concerted disinfor-
ration campaign” in an effort to persuade the media and coasu-
‘mers alike that Alar was not dangerous.

‘The media have a "tremendous problem,” Meyethoff says,
{in uying to accurately and responsibly communicate risk. To be
credible, they must avoid crying wolf too often. But to protect
the public, they must also avoid what he calls "crying sheep"
falling prey to timidity and self-censorship when they're criti-
ized

‘There have been conflicting reports on Alar since the intial
controversy. In 1992, the EPA said its research showed that
“long-term exposure fo Alar poses unacceptable risks to public
