Ads in Reverse
The American Cancer Society has
thought up a new kind of advertis-
ing—uncommercials. Called “Athletes
Against Cancer,” the campaign is a
Series of cigarette testimonials in re-
verse. “I don't smoke,” grins Olympics
Decathlon Champion Bob Mathias.
“Smoking cuts down on wind. And an
athlete needs wind as much as he needs
his legs. Athletes in top condition don't
smoke—they can’t afford to.” Yankee
Pitcher Whitey Ford (who ‘did some
testimonial commercials last year for
Camels) says: “Cigarette smoking is
dangerous for your health. I guess we
all know that Science has proved it to
‘be the major cause of lung cancer.” Oth-
cer anti-cigarette athletes: Track Stars
Jim Beatty and Tom Courtney, Tank
Stars Buster Crabbe and Patricia Me-
Cormick, Fighters Jack Dempsey, Sug-
ar Ray Robinson, and Floyd Patterson.
‘Aiming its ads at young people, the
Cancer Society supplies them free to
‘oational teeo-age magazines that will
promise to run them (ten have so far

‘In Europe the anti-tobacco campaign
is far less circumspect. The British Min-
istry of Health has put up more than a
million posters. One says: “Why be an-
other sheep? Before you smoke, THINK.
Cigarettes cause lung cancer.” Another
shows a half-open coffin, with the leg-
end: “The big Flip-Top Box for the
Smoker.” In Italy, all tobacco advertis-
ing was made illegal in 1962.

ACS Anti-Smoking
Push ‘Succeeds,’ but

Resistance Looms

New York, Oct. 31—Despite
Blowing reports of success of the
“Athletes Against Cancer” anti-
smoking advertising campaign
launched by the American Cancer
Society, it appears that the drive is.
going to encounter some resistance
from media and from at least two
cigaret companies.

‘According to Clifton Read, vp of
the New York ACS office, the
campaign has “exceeded anything
‘we've ever done.” In fact, Mr, Read
‘says the campaign has) been’
‘successful in print media and ra-
lo, that the health organization is
‘expanding its drive into tv.

Mr. Read. cautioned thet
though media may order the ma-
terial, the announcements and ad-
vertisements may not necessarily
reach the public. “But our chap-
ters have to pay for each of these
spots themselves and they don't
‘order the material unless there
se genuine demand,” he said.

Tt was not immediately known
which sports personalities will be
used in the new series of tv an-
ouncements. The society will use
“whoever happens to be avail-
able," Mr, Read said. The radio
campaign, which broke early this
fall (AA, Sept. 9), featured
Whitey Ford, New York Yankees
pitching ace, warning youngsters
to stay away from cigarets. Troni-
cally, Mr. Ford once appeared in
testimonial ads for R. J. Reynolds
cigarets,

Starr, and Jim Beatty.

‘Meantime, the society's _volun-
teer agency, Hockaday Associates,
is preparing a series of print ads
designed for young women con-
sumers. One currently in prepara-
tion shows a young woman skier
who ‘tells feminine readers why
she doesn’t smoke. “I only putt
felting into my stretch pants. Air
‘on the slopes moves me more
than smoke. . . If I don’t know
what to-do with my hands T take
hhis and dance. So who needs a
smoke?”

"RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Co.
pointed out it “has no control over
media, but we always try to see
that our product advertising does
not appear in the company of in-
compatible advertising.”

‘© Douglas Burch, media director
of Liggett & Myers, said his com-
any "would not attempt to influ
fence the editorial and programing
content of media. We are well
‘aware that it would be improper
‘and impossible,” he said, He added
that LAM is concerned, however,
that “proper separation and pro-
tection” of its advertising from
anti-smoking announcements be
maintained by media. "In other
words, we don't want our ads
placed back-to-back with this cane
‘cer campaign.”

‘An ADVERTISING AcE check of
major media in New York indi-
ated that none has as yet re-
ceived the ACS material, Most re
fused to offer a “gratuitous opin
fon” on material that they have
not yet received. An exception was
Don’ Perkins, vp and advertising
director of Look, who said the
‘magazine “would definitely not ac-
cept the ACS material whether it
‘was paid or otherwise. We solicit,
accept, and are proud of our clga-
ret advertising,” sald Mr. Perkins
"Tt would be unfair to the tobacco
industry, since the lnk between
smoking’ and cancer is unproved:
