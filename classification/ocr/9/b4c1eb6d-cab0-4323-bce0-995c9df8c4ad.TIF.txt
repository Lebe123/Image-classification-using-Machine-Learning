Stop harassing smokers

There's no
OPPOSING VIEW Baye to keep

telling people what everyone has
already heard.

A primer coaching anti-smoking activ-
{sts how to get media coverage noted that
“coverage of smoking ... has enjoyed an
extraordinary run.’
‘That same brochure, a
project of the federal
government and an
anti-smoking group,
also told anti-smoking
activists how to dress
during interviews, This
well before the latest
publicity barrage.
Recently, yo
probably read. claims
that there is something,
so compelling about
cigarette advertising
that it makes non-smokers turn to smok-
ing, Never mind that in countries with to-
tbacoo ad bans you may well find more
adults and youngsters smoking than here.
‘There have been stories about fast-food
restaurants. McDonald's, it seems, wants
smokers 10 eat their burgers somewhere
else, Never mind that smoking and non-
smoking areas can accommodate all.
Stories report the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration may move to regulate ciga-

  

 

rettes and claim manufacturers add nico-
tine to cigarettes. Never mind that after
‘manufacturing, there is less nicotine in cig
arettes than naturally occurs in tobacco.

‘Smokers are being singled outas the only
soup of taxpayers to pay the bill for health
are reform. Never mind that this would
require that all notions of tax fairness be
thrown out the window.

‘This paper now suggests that smokers
‘pay taxes to finance more government anti-
smoking messages. Never mind that those
‘are messages that Americans young and
old alike already understand and believe.
‘These are messages already reinforced con-
tinvally and pervasively by the media, the
government, schools and others.

‘Before asking smokers to pay more for
their own harassment, consider: More in
the USA are aware of health claims about
smoking than can identify ‘Wash-
ington; ‘nearly every American believes
smoking is harmful; only 1 of 3 knows Je-
sus delivered the Sermon on the Mount.

‘One state health department produced
advertisements with smokers’ money that
vilify cigarette manufacturers. This ap-
proach — attacking the tobacco industry
— was recently rejected by the federal gov-
‘ernment after testing indicated such mes-
‘sages “did not communicate clearly and ef-
fectively to an audience of young teens.”

‘Clearty, we don’t need to ask smokers to
pay for extravagant and expensive efforts
to tell people what they already have heard.
