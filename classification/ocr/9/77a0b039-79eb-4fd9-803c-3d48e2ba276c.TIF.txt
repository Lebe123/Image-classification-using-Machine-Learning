The Health Realization
Approach to Resiliency

By BONNIE BENARD

In his chronicle of the lives of people struggling
during the Great Depression, Let Us Now Praise Fa-
rus Men, james Agee wrote: "In every child who is
born, under no matter what circumstances, and no
matter what parents, the potentiality of the human
race is born again.” No words better summarize the
belief system inherent in the resiliency paradigm. It
is a belief system that manifests itself in the follow-
ing words to a child or youth: “You can be who you
‘want to be; you can achieve your dream: I believe in,
7°. Tpese words communicate that powerful protec:
tive factor, high expectations, which the child then
internalizes as self-efficacy. The result is not only
motivation but a sense of purpose and bright fu-
ture—enother attsbute of the resilient person. How-
‘ever, many youth hear the opposite message in their
famlies, schools, or communities: “You're not good
enough: your family’s ‘at risk’; your sex, race, cul-
ture, or ethnicity are not good enough: you'll never
amount to anything,” These negative words create
interralized thoughts of impotence, such as: “I'm
‘not good enough there’s no reason to try; things
will never change’”—words reflecting not only loss
of motivation but loss of

Unforuinately, the number of youth growing up
‘with no sense of a bright future is increasing at an.
alarming rate. As one journalist states: “Youthful
‘America’s vision of its own future has never been
more dire, particularly in the cities, As one 17-year-
old African American put it on his way into court ‘T
been dead since Iwas 12, s0 I'm not afraid of dying,
T'm just waiting to get kicked into the grave’ ” (Vo
gel, 1994).

I'd lke to share with you an approach that has
demonstrated effectiveness at facilitating the devel-
opment within youths or adults of the belief that
they are innately resilient—that they have the cape
ity to develop caring relationships, to solve their
‘own problems, to feel good about who they are, and
tobe optimistic about their future. While I've writ-
ten previously about the Health Realization model
developed by Roger Mills (see Benard and Lorio,
1991; Linquant, 1992), Tam continually impressed
by the growing number of practitioners—in the

fields of addiction, education, community organiza-
tion, community policing, organizational develop-
ment, therapy, and counseling —using this approach
across the country in schools, community-based 0
{gonizations, housing projects, treatment centers, hes-
Pitals, businesses, and communitywide collabora-
ions.

I'd like to discuss Health Realization as applied
resiliency, that is, how this approach integrates and
iMustrates our resiliency model, which is grounded
in developing environments rich inthe protective
factors of caring, high expectations, and opporturi-
ties for participation in order to foster the individual
traits of resilience: social competence, problem-solv-
ing, autonomy, and sense of Bright future. Finally,
‘welll discuss what the Health Realization approach
offers the field of prevention and early intervention.

‘The Health Realization approach evolved from
the application of the principles of a new wellness
paradigm in psychology, Psychology of Mind, to the
prevention, early intervention, and community de-
‘velopment arenas. Health Realization began in the
late 1980s with a demonstration project in a Dade
County, Florida, housing project beset with the ef-
fects of poverty and racism: violence, drug-dealing,
domestic violence, teen 7 and school fail-
ure. Today, Health Realization is demonstrating its
effectiveness not only in dramatically reducing the
rates ofall these problems but also in building a
serise of community pride and well-being in commu-
nities across the nation. Some of the findings from
pre-and juations of the 142 families and 604
‘youth involved in the three-year Dade County pro-
ject include significantly improved parent-child rela-
tionships in 87 percent of the families, a75 percent
reduction in delinquency and school-related prob-
Jem behaviors, a 65 percent decrease in drug traffick-
ing, an 80 percent decrease in teen pregnancy, and a
60 percent decrease in substance abuse. Recent find-
ings from the one-and-a-half year Coliseum Gardens
Project in Oakland, California, include a cessation of
all gang warfare and ethnic clashes between the
‘Cambodian and African American youth, 45 per-
cent reduction in violent crimes (and no homicides
since the project began), and a 110 percent increase
in youth involvement in the Boys and Girls Club. A
more massive effort in the South Bronx—the Com-
prehensive Community Revitalization Project in-
