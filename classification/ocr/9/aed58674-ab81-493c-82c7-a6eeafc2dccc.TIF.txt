Isn't it hypocritical to expound piously
‘on the world food shortage and impending
ass starvation while agricultural agencies
«the world over are aiding and promoting
‘he growing of tobacco, “the most widely
grown commercial non-food plant in the
twortd™ (I)? To be sure, tobacco does con-
tribute to population erosion through em-
physema and cancer, but this hardly seems
& humane means of population control,
and these diseases cause a great drain on
‘medical resources and finances.

‘Since 4438 pereent of the world’s vast to-
acco acreage lies in “starving” Asia (I),
‘would it not be humanitarian to offer eco
TRomic inducements to farmers to switch
from tobacco to food crops?

‘It people must smoke, let their cigarettes
be made of a less toxic plant material—not
‘2 monopolizer of arable land,"but a vege
table by-product of food crops, say, cab-
‘age, lettuce, or papaya leaves.
