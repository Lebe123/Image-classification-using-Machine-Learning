“What's Your Cancer Profile? [Smoking Does Not Necessarily Lead to

Lung Cancer]"
Washington Post-Health (09/19/95) P. 12; Weiss, Rick

Despite the claim that lung cancer is directly linked to smoking, about one in seven
people diagnosed with the disease are nonsmokers. Although cigarettes are currently
the single most preventable cause of cancer, 85% of smokers never contract lung
cancer. Researchers say this may be because while one person may be especially
sensitive to one carcinogen, he or she may be resistant to another, depending on the
particular combination of genes the person inherited.

Most carcinogens are usually benign when they are first Inhaled, swallowed, or
absorbed through the skin. It is only when they come in contact with various
activating enzymes in the body that the carcinogens become threatening, since some
of the body's ordinary compounds can have an untoward effect on carcinogens and
make them chemically unstable and electrically charged. Studies in molecular
epidemiology have determined that cancer is the result of a complex interaction
between gene makeup and environmental factors.

Cancer}"

Scientists have found that people with an increased risk of cancer due to a lack of
certain enzymes that neutralize carcinogens may benefit from foods that supply those
enzymes or increase the production of those enzymes in the body. In

performed on rats exposed to a cigarette carcinogen, a dose of the PEITC enzyme) an
inhibitor found in watercress, caused a 50% reduction in lung tumors, according to
‘American Health Foundation director of research Stephen Hecht. Hecht said he and his
researchers believe that a pill containing these types of inhibitor substances might
be a way to reduce lung cancer in smokers who are addicted to cigarettes, but
stressed that the best thing for people to do is to quit smoking.
