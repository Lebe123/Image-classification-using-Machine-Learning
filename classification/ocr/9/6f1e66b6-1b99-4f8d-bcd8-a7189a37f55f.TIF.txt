Volunteers throughout the New’ York
State Division are conducting a unique
American Cancer Society quest for
information that might reveal vital
leads to fight a disease that kills one out
of every four Americans.

“Actually, these invaluable volun-
teers are re-opening the “Society's
‘massive Cancer Prevention Study,” Dr.
George H. Shields, President, New York
State Division, explained. “That study
began in 1959 and was continued for six

years. Approximately one million
‘Américans were questioned about their
2-54 health and living habits. Now we must

‘many died and of what form of eancer.”

‘Tremendous amounts of information «
have come out of the data assembled
thus far,” he explained. “Just to give @
few examples much of what we know
about the dangers of cigarette smoking
come from the study. We've learned that
urban air pollution has very itl if any

the risk of lung cancer.”

‘The study demonstrated the great
importance of abnormal bleeding as a
warning signal for eancer ofthe uterus.

what we mean by cancer prevention.”
Dr. Shields said, “We know that if we
‘can detect this form of cancer early we
‘ean save these women.”

Headded, “For many years there was
a debate as. to whether tuberculosis

lung cancer is almost exactly the same
