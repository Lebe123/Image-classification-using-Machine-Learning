Reaching Spanish readers

LA.’s Latino market is growing fast, and advertisers are beginning to take notice

WADE DANIELS—Contributing Reporter

With Spanish-language radio leading
local ratings and Spanish-language
KMEX Channel 34 broadcasting
Southern California's most-watched tele-
vision news, ever-growing numbers of
advertisers are buying ai time on Spanish
language stations.

However, too few advertising dollars are
‘lowing into Spanish-language print media,
according to JSA Publishing Ine., which is
‘working to capitalize on that situation

“Too many advertisers assume Hispanics
and immigrants can’t read,” suid Marcelino
Miyares Jt, president of JSA En Espail, a
division of the Santa Monica-based publish
cer and producer of two national Spanish-lan-
guage magazines. “We have the data hat
says 80 percent of Latinos and immigrants
are literate?

Each month, JSA En Espanol goes to 1.2
rillion doors, natidnwide with copies of
Hogarama and Mundo Deportivo, a home-
‘maker magazine and sports magazine,
respectively.

“What really sets the magazine apart
are their educational context,” suid Miyares.
“We're not the only way to reach a lotof peo-
ple in this market, but we reach them in an
‘educational context that adds meaning to the
communication.”

“Miyares says the magazines aim to famil~
iarize their readers with the differences
between American consumerism and that of
their homeland.

Hogarama, for example, shows readers
which American products to use in preparing
‘Mexican dishes, as well as how those prod>
‘uts differ from the ones back home. In this
‘way, Miyares sed, immigrants can assimilate
‘while holding on to their cultural identity

‘The strategy appears to be paying off,
{ISA's roverwes in 1995 were $5.1 milion, up
rom $524,000 in 1990, its frst year in bus
ness, That'sa five-year growth rate of 835 per

‘cent, earning ita ranking inthe Inc, $00. SA
has not announced its 1996 financial results.

‘Miyares noted that the magazines, unlike
‘many other Spanish-language publications,
include only content produced within the
United States.

Ray Durazo of Durazo
‘Communications Inc, Los Angeles adver.
tising consulting firm, agreed that educating
new arrivals isa good way for advertisers to
appeal to them.

Durazo said his company advises clients
toinclude practical information about how to
use products.

‘Ads for health products with which
jmmigrants may not be familiar should
include in-depth explanations of their uses
and benefits. Bank ads should outline how to
tse financial products as basic as checking
accounts, which only the upper class uses in
Mexico, he said,

Agencia de Orci & Associates, a Los
Angeles-based agency specializing in adver-

 
 
 
 
 
  
  
   
 

Using to the Latino market, said Hogarama
‘and Mundo Deportivo are atractve because
they offer direct mail advertisers opportunities
to get involved in promodonal events that SA.
stages in local Hispanic communities.

“Another attraction for advertisers seeking
significant market penctrations is that the
publications are ing on the doorknobs of
1.2 millon houssholds each month in such
large metro areas as Los Angeles, (500,000
households), New York, Texas-anywhere the
USS. Census Bureau spots a concentration of
{foreign-bom Spanish speakers.

‘These companion publications constitute
the nation’s Ingest Spanish-language print
‘ehicle delivered to the market segment. And
Miyares sid the JSA publications delivery
cost to advertisers is one-tenth of normal
rece mail rates.

Until Hogarama and Mundo Deportivo
Potasinski sai, advertisers were limited t0
buying space in publications with small
print runs of only a few hundred thousand
copies, hardly substantial considering Los
‘Angeles alone has a Hispanic population of
64 million

ISA Publishing was founded as a custom
publisher in 1990 by Jeff Stem, who earlier
founded Details magazine in Now York and
sold it to Conde Nast Publications Inc.

He and Miyares crested Hogerama

because they saw no masscircu-
lation color print vehicle for
Spanish speakers and had con-
Ta eluded that the segment’s direct
|) mall business was “coming of
uit age.” To beter reach Spanish-
speaking males, JSA introduced
‘Mundo Deportivo in 1995 and
began to deliver it in tandem with
S25) Hogarama,

ISA Publishing also puts out @
‘monthly English-language hip-hop
magazine called Rap Sheet and is
planning more Spanish-language
magazines.
