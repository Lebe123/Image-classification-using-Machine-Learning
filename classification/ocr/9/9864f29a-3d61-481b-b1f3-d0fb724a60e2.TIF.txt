Lire DISSATISFACTIONS

Studies from several countries agree that patients
with coronary disease are particularly apt to report
Gissatisfuctions in many areas of their lives.
Blohmke and her colleagues compared men in five
categories of coronary disease with a control popula-
tion? One or more of the categories were distin~
guished from contrals by each of the followin vari-

 

fables: tedious work, vocational difficulties in the
past 10 years, aud. feeling of being ill at ease
at place of work. In each case of a significant
difference, the sroups with coronary disease more
often reported the job dissatisfaction, Brulin et al.
fina study of interview data from G4 patients: in
Oklahoma’ found more frequent job difficulties and
xecater reported lack of recognition by superiors
fmnong the workers with coronary disease than
among the matched controls. In a related paper
