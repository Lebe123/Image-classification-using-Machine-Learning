Major U.S. Tobacco Companies Set To Challenge FDA Proposal

 

detail, Tobacco companies plan an 11 a.m, EST news conference in
‘Washington; will be led. Also moving on general news wires.

NEW YORK (AP) Five major U.S. cigarette makers have united to
argue that the Food and Drug Administration exceeded its authority
‘with a proposal to restrict minors’ access to tobacco products,
newspapers reported today.

‘The FDA's proposed rule, issued last summer, declares that,
cigarettes are a drug-delivery device, and therefore subject 0 FDA
jurisdiction.

The proposal would require tobacco companies to fund a $150
rillion annual advertising campaign to warn children ofthe health
dangers of smoking. It also would ban cigarette sales from vending
machines and impose restrictions on advertising tobacco product
areas deemed accessible to minors.

Ina jointly submitted response, the cigarette makers said they
‘will argue the FDA's proposal would violate U.S. law and the U.S.
Constitution. The industry claims the FDA does not have federal
statutory authority to regulate cigarettes. The New York Times and
The Wall Street Joumal both carried reports on the challenge
today.

In their 2,000-word response, the companies said they will also
argue that nicotine does not fit the legal definition of a drug and
that its effects do not fit the legal definition of addiction.

The companies Philip Morris U.S.A., RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,
Brown & Williamson, Lorillard Tobacco Co. and Liggett Group will
submit their response today, the last day of the FDA rule's comment
period, the newspapers said

‘An FDA spokesman dectined to comment on the tobacco companies’
response, the Journal said,

Tobacco companies also filed a lawsuit against the FDA last year
in an effort to block the agency's plan to regulate cigarettes.

As part of the federal rule-making process, the FDA must
consider the complaints and compile a record of how it responded to
them before issuing a final policy. An FDA spokesman told the Times
he didn't know how long that would take.
