“We Card" Program Announced to Help Prevent
Tobacco Sales to Minors

For the first time ever, the nation's largest retailer
and wholesaler organizations have joined forces to address
head-on the issue of youth smoking.

The group, representing more than 150,000 retailers
nationwide, will work together through the Coalition for
Responsible Tobacco Retailing with support from Philip
Morris and the rest of the tobacco industry.

“This is the result of an extraordinary effort from
many organizations," said Teri Richman, spokeswoman for the
coalition. "The Coalition for Responsible Tobacco Retailing
represents a cooperative and dedicated national effort among
retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers who all share one
common goal -- to do everything we can to prevent tobacco
sales to minors."

At a recent news conference, the coalition announced a
major new program, called “We Card," that will provide
training and educational materials to retailers to help
prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors.

The “We Card" program marks the first unified effort
ever by the tobacco industry to address the youth smoking
issue. The “We Card" program uses tested ideas to build on
previous efforts. It offers heightened awareness and
thorough employee training to improve compliance with laws

that prohibit the sale of tobacco products to minors.
