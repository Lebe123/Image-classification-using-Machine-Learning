Trends in lung cancer mortality

Care is needed in the interpretation of statistics
such as these. Apparent inereases in mortality may
arise from improvements in diagnoss (for example,
through the troduction of diagnostic rachology a
bronchoscopy) or from changes in diagnostic fas
ton. At the Same time, improvements in treatment
may reduce mortality while incidence rates femal
