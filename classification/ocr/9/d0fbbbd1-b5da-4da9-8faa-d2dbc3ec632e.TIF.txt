There is an issue currently facing Tennesseans and their
agricultural heritage that is much more complex than would be
realized at first glance. The issue is that of regulatory
jurisdiction of tobacco-related products
For those Tennesseans not involved in agriculture production or
non-tobacce users, the issue vould seem even more insignificant than
However, this is an issue of tremendous importance to

    

 

Last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a
far-reaching plan to exercise regulatory control over the marketing
and sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. The foundation for
this action is based on the FDA assumption that tobacco products are
a delivery device of nicotine

 

 

Two major concerns arise from this regulatory initiative. While
the anti-tobacco forces of today's society argue that the tobacco
issue should be addressed without regard to economics, it is
unrealistic to do so.

Economics cannot be disregarded for it is the very purpose of the
production process. Tobacco producers do not grow tebacco to create
a ‘‘drug delivery system.'! Tebacco producers grow tobacco in order
to pay the bills that in turn help maintain other business activity.

Production has, through the years, passed on a strong work ethic,
an ability to provide for a family on limited production resources,
land significant economic benefit to the local, state and federal tax
revenue. It has clothed, fed and educated a significant number of
Tennesseans.

It is interesting to note that Tennessee passed a temporary tax in
1925 on tobacco products to fund education. That tax was made
permanent in 1927, and in 1994 resulted in an excess of $84 million
for education. No other product can compete with that contribution,
just as no other product can offer the return on investment to the
Producer. If the demand for any product provided the production
incentive of tobacco, producers would respond.

Alternative crops are often suggested, however, if a major shift
to any other production was successful without major marketing
network changes for that production, chaos and bankruptcy would be
the result for many.

 

Aside from economics, another major concern arises from this FDA
