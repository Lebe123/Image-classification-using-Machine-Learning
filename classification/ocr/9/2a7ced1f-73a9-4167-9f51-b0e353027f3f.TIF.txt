COMMISSION ENFORCEMENT POLICY STATEMENT IN REGARD TO CLEAR AND
CONSPICUOUS DISCLOSURE IN TELEVISION ADVERTISING

The Commission in recent years has issued various opinions, orders and trade
regulation rules that are concerned with the need for affirmative disclosures in
connection with certain kinds of representations. These disclosures have been required,
in general terms, to be “clear and conspicuous". Because questions have been raised
as to the specific meaning of the term "clear and conspicuous", the Commission deens
it appropriate to set forth the standards it considers in determining whether, in fact,
an affirmative disclosure in a television commercial 1s "clear and conspicuous".

“I. In making this determination, the Conmission will take into consideration all
the technical factors (size of letters, duration of disclosure, etc.) used in present
ing the disclosure to a television audience as well as the substance of the individual
disclosure. Specifically, the Commission believes that each of the following specific
Standards should be met for a television disclosure to be deemed clear and conspicuous:

A, The disclosure should be presented simultaneously in both the audio and video
portions of the television advertisement.

B. The video portion of the disclosure must contain letters of sufficient size
80 that it can be easily seen and read on all television sets, regardless of s
Picture tube size, that are commercially available for the consuming public.

C. The video portion of the disclosure should contain letters of a color or
shade that readily contrast with the background. The background should consist
of only one color or shade.
