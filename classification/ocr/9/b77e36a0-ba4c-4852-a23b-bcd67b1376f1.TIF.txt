Dr. Carr's Smoking Views Attacked

Dr. Dean F. Davies, pro-
fessor of preventive medi-
cine at the U-T Medical
Units, today sharply eriti-
cized’ the arguments used by
another U-T faculty mem-
ber, Dr. Duane Carr, who
told a Congressional commit:
tee this week that there was
Ro proven link between
‘smoking and lung cancer.
“The evidence is so over-
whelming that smoking is
the chief causative factor in
ig cancer that any physi
cian who would contend oth-
erwise just hasn't kept up
with the massive sweep of
medical literature for’ the
past five years,” sald Dr.
Davies, who also operates @
smoking prevention clini.

ENGAGED in smoking re-
search for more than 13,
years, Dr. Davies stacked
books’ on top of books that
eached the ceiling of his of
fice and cited these authori
ti

DAViES came to Memphis,
in 1966 from the faculty of
Columbia University Medi-
cal Center, New York. He
served as executive director
of the American Cancer So-
ciety for five yearsand pub-
lished a report six years be-
fore the 1854 U.S, Surge

Sent to Ad Hoc & Staff

  

General's report, reaching
the same conclusions —
namely, that smoking causes
ung cancer and 2 host of
other respiratory diseases.

Dr. Carr, clinical professor
of ‘thoracic surgery and
founder of the Thoracic Sur-
gery Association, told. the
House Commerce Committee
that assuming for argu-
‘ment's sake that only cigaret
smokers developed lung can-
cer, that with about 70 mil-
lion smokers in the nation,
there would only be one
death per 1,400 smokers.

Dr. Davies said this argu-
ment was “fallacious” be-
‘cause smoking causes so
‘many other diseases that kill
lung. cancer victims betore
the” cancer progresses to @
fatal state. Davies said there
are twice as many people
who die of ‘heart attacks
each year than with lung
cancer.

QUOTING a US. Public
Health study published last
year, Dr. Davies seid cigae
et ‘smoking increases the
likelihood of death by coro-
nary disease by about 70 per
ccent. For persons suffering
from high blood pressure,

 

5-26-69

the risk jumps to 200 per
cent if they smoke, Davies
said,

From the same’ report,
Davies said over a quarter
of a. million premature
deaths occur each year from
diseases associated with
aret smoking and that there
are 11 million extra cases of
‘chronic disease in cigaret
smoking populations
compared "to non-smoking
populations.

-. Davies said the com-
mittee Dr. Carr testified be-
fore is considering legisla
tion to ban cigaret commer
cials on television

“The — smoking-causes-
lung-cancer controversy end-
ed ‘long ago,” Dr. Davies
sald. “The issue today is
hhow to break the chain of
children copying adults who
are hooked on cigarets.”

He added: “One wonders
about the topsy-turvy society
which spends money throvgh
government expenditures to
prevent food poisoning, but
‘then turns right around and
spends millions of dollars
throwgh advertising for ar
industty which manipulate
the citizen’ and” p
him to an early death,
