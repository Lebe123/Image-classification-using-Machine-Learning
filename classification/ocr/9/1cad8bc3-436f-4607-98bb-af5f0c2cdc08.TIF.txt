Drug prevention money coup for Big Tobacco,
critics claim

State officials trumpeted a $4.5 million program Thursday that they say will help
more than 21,000 West Virginia schoolchildren stay off tobacco, alcohol and other
drugs.

But some health advocates say West Virginia should have turned the money down,
because it comes from tobacco companies and because the deal was brokered by a
tobacco warehouse in Wéod County.

The program, announced by Gov. Cecil Underwood and state schools
Superintendent Henry Marockie, will provide $4.5 million over three years for the
Life Skills Training program, West Virginia is the first state to implement the
program statewide.

Next year, more than 21,000 sixth-graders across the state will have 15 sessions
under the program, urging them not to use tobacco, alcohol and other drugs. They
will have 10 sessions as seventh-graders and five as eighth-graders.

We need new options to prevent young people from falling into the grip of
addiction to tobacco and other controlled substances," Underwood said during a
press conference at Kanawha City Elementary School.

‘The two companies providing the $4.5 million, Philip Morris and Brown &
Williamson, are two of the four tobacco companies who agreed last year to settle
lawsuits by 46 states, The tobacco industry will pay the states more than $200
billion over 25 years,

Marockie saluted the two businessmen who hooked the state up with the tobacco
companies: Jack Bemheimer, president of Goldsmith-Black Co., and John Plesich,
a consultant for the company.

Goldsmith-Black is a grocery and tobacco warehouse in Wood County. In 1995,
the company sued to prevent its local health department from enforcing a ban on
smoking in indoor public places. A circuit judge threw the lawsuit out.

"This is the tobacco companies’ attempt to find legitimacy with adults," said Sara
Crickenberger, executive director of the American Lung Association of West
Virginia. "This is selling our state's name to give the tobacco industry a good
name.
