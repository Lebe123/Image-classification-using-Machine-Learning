“American Cancer Society Seeks a Reopening of Hearings on Tobacco”
New York Times (06/14/95) P. A16; Collins, Glenn

‘The American Cancer Society called upon Congress on Tuesday to reopen hearings on
the nation's tobacco manufactures, saying that the tobacco industry had "surreptitiously"
obtained its 1979 working papers about tobacco's cancer-causing effects. The allegation
came in response to the disclosure last week of the existence of documents revealing that
Philip Morris Inc. had conducted 15 years of research on nicotine's effects on the physical
and behavioral aspects of smokers. Papers from the cancer society were amiong the
documents. Dr. LaMar McGinnis, the society's president, said Tuesday that the society
assumed that the tobscco industry's intention was to use the society's data “to help plan
their own counter-strategy of dismissing the huge health consequences of tobacco use,
and further increase their sales.”

 

Philip Morris attomey Charles R. Wall said the cancer society offered no proof that the
papers weren't obtained through legitimate measures. Cancer society spokesman Thomas
Brandt countered that a working document on a policy issue would not have been made
available to the public until a decision had been made on it, The eancer society said the
documents included its draft policy statement on low tar and nicotine cigarettes, dated
October 19, 1979, and prepared for a meeting the following month. Brandt said that
statement was obtained by the Tobacco Institute several weeks prior to that meeting and
\was sent to various tobacco company execuitives. Related Story: USA Today (06/14) P.
