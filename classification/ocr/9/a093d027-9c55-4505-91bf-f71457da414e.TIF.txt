RAISE YOUR TAXES AGAIN !!!

The California State Legislature is currently considering proposals
to increase the state excise tax on cigarettes. One of these
proposals, AB55, goes so far as to give local Boards of
Supervisors, throughout the state, the power to impose unlimited
tax increases on cigarettes. Under this proposal, local elected
officials could actually double the price consumers pay for
cigarettes. This proposal gives local government the power to
solve local financial problems by raising cigarette taxes.
