COYNE BEAHM JOINS MAJOR CIGARETTE MANUFACTURERS IN LAWSUIT
AGAINST THE FDA

COLFAX, N.C., Aug. 10 /PRNewswite/ -- Coyne Beam Inc., a North Carolina-based
advertising and marketing agency, has announced today that it has joined with

the five major US. cigarette manufactures in filing a suit against the U.S.

Food & Drug Administration and David A. Kessler, M.D.., the agency's

‘commissioner. The lawsuit was filed for the purpose of asking the court to

declare that the FDA does not have the jurisdiction to regulate cigarettes.

 

"As an advertising and marketing agency, we fully agree with the tobacco
companies that the Food and Drug Administration simply has no authority to
regulate tobacco, nor activities related to it," said Roger Beahm, president of

Coyne Beahm Inc. "As we understand the FDA's proposed rules, they would have a
significant effect on Our business. In addition to regulating the manufacturers,

the FDA intends to regulate advertising and marketing agencies such as ours, and
retailers who sell cigarettes. We believe the FDA simply does not have that
authority.

 

"We all agree kids shouldn't smoke. If that is the objective of the FDA,

these rules make it an objective designed to fail. The proposed regulations

don't deal with the real factors affecting why kids smoke -- that is peer and
family influences. While we recognize access is an issue, the tobacco companies
are already implementing programs which research has shown to reduce underage
access. It appears that rather than trying to take action which would really

help keep cigarettes out of the hands of children, the FDA has decided to try to
regulate not only the tobacco industry, but advertising and marketing agencies
like ours, and retailers who are involved in the sale of cigarettes, We hope

the FDA will reconsider, and that a truly workable plan designed to help keep
cigarettes out of the hands of children can be agreed upon.”
