In one sense, there 1s a precedent.
Broadcasters have a long-established poll:

C Puffing Or Bluffing? :

 

the air. As long as cigarettes are a¢-
cepted as safe enough to sell, the ad-
vertising of competitive brands, with-
in the limits of truth and decency,
should not be restricted.

Congress isn’t likely to permit the
FCC to carry out its threat, which
would amount to bureaucratic sup-
pression. Pethaps the agency realizes
that; but the fact that such an edict
is comtemplated seems to reflect the
distorted self-image of power this
federal commission has assumed and
apparently seeks to exercise.

Not that we advocate the smoking
of cigarettes; they MAY well be, as

the labels maintain, a potential men-
ace. But so, in thi
FCC. .
