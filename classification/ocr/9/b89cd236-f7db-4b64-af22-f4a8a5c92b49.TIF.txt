‘PHOENIX, Artz.

‘The Publle Health’ Service
‘believes it has underestimated
the danger of cigarette smok-
ng as the result of its recent
atudy of 42.000 American
households — the “broadest
murvey yet of the nicotine
habit’ as e hazard to health

“Yesterday, Surgeon General
‘Willam Stewart reported his
‘im and as yet unpublisned
‘pdings Betmeen Jy 1 1066

July 1, 1963, PHS men
falked about amoking with
42.000 families, then projected.
these conclusions:

(That Americans 17 years
‘ot age of older reported 12
‘million more chronic ailments
during the test year than they
‘would have reported if they
had not smoked,

CThat there were 300,000
extra coronary attacks, a ml-

Mon extra eases of bronchitis
‘or emphysema. and another
‘millon extra eases of peptic
leers.

‘CThat_ Americans spent
900,000 more days sick in bed
than they would. have spent
Af the total population enjoyed
the same disease rate as non-
smokers.

‘The report prepared by the
‘Burgeon Geriéral was given to
fan American Cancer ‘Society
teminar here by Dr. Eugene
Guthrle, he Assistant Surgeon
General for Operations, in.the
abeence of Dr. Stewart, eho
was called to. testify before
Congress.

PREDICTION

‘According to the Surgeon
General, the data avaliable on
time lost from work due to
cigarette smoking shows the
eos “eould run into billions
of dollars

‘Dr. Stewart's report was
ellvered minutes after» na-
tonally renowned Harvard
sclentist, himself a victim of
Tung cancer, predicted that a
safe and salable cigarette will
never be Invented. According
to Dr. Louts Fieser, the chern=
at who synthesized Vitamin

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

‘The reason: Spinach, Uke
‘most plants, contains much
cxlilose,

   
 

Although Americans are
smoking mote cigarettes than
fever, Dr. Stewart denied that
fanti-clgarette campaigns led
by his agency have been ine

 

364. According to Dr. Stew-
fart, © amaller percentage of
the “male population now
aamokes cigarettes than at any
{ime during the past 50 years.
Another ray of hope 1s that
18. million ‘adults, tncluding
half the physicians who once
moked, “have Kicked the
Iabit, apparently for good.

‘The 1965 law requiring «
“caution” label’ on elgarette
packs also orders the PHS and,
the Federal Trade Commission
to report back to. Congress
in July, 1967, on effects of
the Inbel change. If the PHS.
decides this has been effective,
‘we might very" well recom
mend additional Tegisiator
Dr. Guthrie said yesterday.

Serious disappointment was
expressed by the Surgeon
General over Congress’ refusal
to pass a stronger measure,
‘Which also would have forced
cigarette makers to display
enutionary ‘warnings jn ad-
Vertisements” His. remares
contained the hint the PHS
ay campalgn again for auch
ala when ft delivers ft
report to Congress.
