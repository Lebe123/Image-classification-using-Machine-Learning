Michael Andretti just shook his
head in frustration.

“The difference was maybe 21/5
feet on.a fourmile racetrack,” An-
Gretti said after Gil de Ferran
nipped him Friday for the provi-
sional pole in the opening round
‘of qualifying for the Motorola 220
at Road America near Elkhart
Lake.

De Ferran, who can cut Andret-
t's lead tn the CART FedEx Se-
ries standings to 18 points if he
hangs onto the single point for
‘winning the pole, turned a lap of
145.159 mph on the 4.048:mile, 14
turn course. Final qualifying is
today.

Andretti’s fast lap of 145.146,
‘was just 0.009 of a second slower.

“We got off to a good start with
our first set of tires and we were
‘making it better,” said Andretti,
‘who is going for his third straight
pole on the undulating eastern
‘Wisconsin course. “Then all the
red flags started to happen.”

‘The 30-minute session was filled
with off-course excursions by a
number of drivers — including
defending series champion Juan
‘Montoya — bringing out red flags
‘that halted the action for several
minutes.
