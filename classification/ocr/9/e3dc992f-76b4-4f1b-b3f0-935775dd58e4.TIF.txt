Helena, Mont.

Both the Governor and the mem-
‘vers hope that the legislature's budg-
et session can be completed without
raising taxes. Except, of course, the
levies on cigarettes and alcoholic bev-
erages. But those don't count be-
cause in Kansas they still are sym
bols of sin.

‘The News strongly opposes adding
another penny a package to the tax

= on cigarettes. Tt does so simply be-
cause that isn’t nearly enough. ‘The
tax should be advanced at least 30
and perhaps even 50 cents.

‘This proposal, fantastic although it

ay at first seem, would provide sev-
eral millions a year in added revenue
which the state needs badly, even
though it undoubtedly would bring
about a sharp drop in cigarette sales.

But this is not the primary reason
for making this recommeéndation. The
News does so as a matter of public
health. If Kansas once thought it vie
tal to eliminate the common drinking
‘cup and the house fly, today in the
light of the Surgeon General's com-
mittee report, it should do what it
feasibly can to discourage the use of
Aigarettes.

ven. 4, 196 Government Aid in Selling Poison

Everybody's talking about cigarets,
but we'll lay you 10 to one that nobody
‘ever does anything about them,

In foct, we might even go farther and
predict thet the United States govern-
ment, which has raised the question of
tthe smoker poisoning himself in a multi-
tude of different ways through his use
of the weed, will go right along helping
him in the process.

For the biggest foundation to the
tobacco industry is.the subsidy which the
Department of Agriculture pays to
‘tobacco growers who hove skillfully man-
‘eged to keep production high in spite of
restriction of supported ocreage.

In other words, we undoubtedly will
see the federal compaign against the
tse of tobacco gother impetus while the
government continues to pay formers
for raising it.

‘And, at the same time everyone will
debate about what should be done. Some
will say thet the tobacco industry should
not be allowed to advertise. Some will
say that the type of advertising shuld
be censored. Some will want a counter

  

 

rogram to advertise the ills which result
from the use of tobacco. We would give
‘dds that none of these will be adopted
‘end would not produce much in the way
of results if they were,

If we were serious about stopping. or
reducing the use of tobacco there ore
two simple steps which would be effec-
tive

‘One would be to cut off the support to
the tobacco grower. This could even be
reversed by requiring @ license for the
privilege of growing @ poison weed and
charging a tax for each acre planted,

Then the government could double its
tox on the finished product, @ tax which
already is the biggest factor in the re-
toil price.

Few are going to quit smoking because
they are ofraid of lung cancer or any
other disease, They know that it is al-
ways the other fellow who is stricken.

Few will quit smoking becouse it is
forbidden or even because the product
is made difficult to acquire.

But many will quit if it is mode more
expensive.
