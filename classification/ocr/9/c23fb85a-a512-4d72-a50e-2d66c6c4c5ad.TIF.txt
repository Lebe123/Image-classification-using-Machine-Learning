WORKERS CAN BE ‘BRIBED’ TO LIVE
HEALTHY LIFESTYLES, CONFERENCE TOLD

CHICAGO — (By a BNA Staff Correspondent) —
For the right price, workers can be bribed to quit
‘smoking, exercise, lower their cholesterol levels, and
engage in other healthy behavior, a consulting actuary
told a wellness conference here.

“Let's face it, money is a motivator—even if it's 10
bucks a month,” said Stephen Brink, principal and
consulting actuary for Milliman & Robertson Inc, at
the Worksite Wellness Council of Greater Chicago's
WellBusiness 2000 conference on Sept. 26. “As actu-
aries, we know that people who have $100 deductibles
use their health benefits more than those with higher
deductibles. Finances are a motivator.”

‘The practice of using financial incentives and disin-
centives to healthy behavior, such as dis-
counted and inflated deductibles and cash gifts, is still
in the experimental stages, but is gaining in popular-
ity, according to Brink. Only about 2 percent of the
nation’s companies have instituted such programs,
which grew out of wellness programs in place at about
80 percent of US. companies, he said.

ither by using a disincentive approach—taking
money away—or an incentive agenda—providing cash
gifts—an increasing number of employers are trying
to help their workers control weight, lower blood
pressure, reduce stress, promote mental health, and
cut down on back problems, Brink said.

Evidence is scarce on the amount of money that
such programs are saving companies, Brink said.
However, evidence does show that the programs are
{influencing health behavior, he added.

One of Milliman & Robertson's clients, Execufit of
San Francisco, used incentive programs to cut high-
risk smoking behavior by 50 percent, moved 20 per-
ccent of high blood pressure sufferers into a low risk
category, and moved 10 percent of participants af-
filcted with weight problems and high cholesterol into
low-risk groups, Brink said.

Some companies aod state employers who have
launched similar programs include Adolph Coors Co;
Foldcraft; Hershey Foods Corp.; the Kansas state gov-
‘ernment; Southern California Edison Co; Sara Lee
Corp; and Lutheran Health Systems. The programs
range from focusing on one or two health problems to
‘a wider array of health behavior, Brink said.

These involve giving employees monthly cash gifts
of between $5 and $10 for maintaining healthier life-
styles to penalizing workers by increasing deductibles
up to $900 annually for failing to achieve health goals,
he said

“Positive incentives seem to work better than nega-
tive incentives, but there is no conclusive evidence
data on which works better,” Brink said. "I personally
think positive incentives work better than disincen-
tives programs,” he added.

‘Any relatively common, high-risk behavior that can
be measured and changed is a candidate for an incen-
tive program, Brink asserted.
