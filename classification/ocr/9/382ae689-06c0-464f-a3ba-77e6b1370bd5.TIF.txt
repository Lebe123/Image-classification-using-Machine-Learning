Cancer Policy
Board Urged To Study Access,
Research Funding, Tobacco

Research funding, tobacco control and access
to health care and clinical trials were among the
policy issues that cancer advocacy and professional
‘organizations urged a new, potentially influential

public service by addressing difficult issues

 

confronting cancer research and clinical care.

Medicine at the request of NCI Director Richard
Klausner. Board members were selected from a
variety of fields related to oncology, including
clinical and basic research, prevention, drug
development, health services, patient care, and
patient advocacy.

Following the tradition of other NAS advisory
sroups, the board plans to conduct workshops,

priorities in a paper tobe released by the end of May.
