position to Measure 25,
‘So has Democratic Gov. John Kitzhaber.

Tn a statement in the Oregon Voters’
Pamphlet paid for by the OEA, the gover-
nor said he opposes the measure “because,
quite simply, it's bad for Oregon.

If this measure were to pass, a minority
of either house would be able to hold rev-
enue matters hostage over unrelated is-
sues. Only 25 representatives or 13 sena
tons could use this taetie to enforce minor-
ity rule.”

‘On the other hand, Associated Oregon
Industries, the state's largest busines«
lobbying organization, has recommended
support of the measure.

‘The AOI says Measure 25 would apply
only to measures whose primary purpose is
raising revenue and not to measures with
fan incidental purpose of raising revenue.

Should Measure 25 be approved by the
voters, Oregon would join 12 other states
imposing supermajority requirements on
legislation to raise taxes.

‘Two of those are California and Wash:
