Pentagon smoking ban: Misplaced priorities

We ask people to risk their
lives for their country, then
tell them they can’t smoke?

‘The smoking lamp is going out

‘With the Peniagon banning smoking in
the workplace, soldiers will now be de-
ployed to godforsaken corners ofthe globe
{obe shot, gassed, bombed, sprayed with
herbicide, Kidnapped, tortured and incin-
‘erated — but at least they won't have to

‘tank lighting up a cigarette.
‘That secondhand srmoke sa killer.
‘This lates move is another step in the

‘march toward a smoke-free rlitary. The

‘Navy's assistant surgeon general even sug

‘gested that i the future only nonsmokers

‘Should be recruted.

Tmno fan of smoking, but come on. Sol-
diess are rskakers, They go ino the mil-
{ary to risk their lives for thelr country
‘Then thelr country tells them they east
sk thelr health fora cigarette?

‘Smokefree work zones are fine for dan-
difed enviroament like law firms, insur

'But | wonder what the Pentagon will say
‘when some poor sailor who's been walking
the deck of'an alrraft carrer, feeing i
coming tramic, ducking backdratts,
breathing jet fumes and carting around
deadly explosives in an ear-spliting din all,

 

 

fine and wonderful to allow wornen
‘tothe military and into combat roles if

that’s where they prefer to be — and we

‘can all applaud the equanimity of those

Policies. Bu only a fool would believe such

Just two days before the Pentagon

Obviously, you can make all the rules
‘bout fraternization you want, but if you
‘pt female sailors on ships with mate gall-
‘rs, sooner or later they are going to get
‘around to having sex with eachother. Is
‘one of those irepressible natural insines
that has kept the human race procreating
{or the last? milion years.

‘Just because the Pentagon decrees that
‘sexs against the rules does mean it will
‘Stop. And the number of pregnant sailors
‘eturning from sea bears tis out

‘But the arrogance of these rule makers
really knows to bounds. They not only
think they can outlaw the sex drive, but
row they even belleve they can prevent
you from having a cigarette after you've
