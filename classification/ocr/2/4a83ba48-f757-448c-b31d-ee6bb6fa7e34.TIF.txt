I met with Veronica this morning to update the Communications section. | walked her through the strategy
portion of the presentation I gave to the Sr. Team. Veronica has enough information to update the section
‘with all the new information, including Carolyn's comments. | should have a revised section by the end of
‘next week, and I'll review it immediately. | will send you two and legal copies simultaneously to save time.

‘The step after that is to meet as a group to discuss how to evolve the info kit. Please let me know if you
have any comments. Thanks.
