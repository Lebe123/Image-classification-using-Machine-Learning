‘The production dates of the Salem Lts 84 CPB complaints, according to the pack codes
provided by Y. Kawamura in her latest spreadsheet dated 12/20/96, are:

 

May 77 Complaints
May 137 Complaints

May 141 Complaint

May 20 1 Complaint

May 23 5 Complaints

May 24 1 Complaint

May 294 Complaints

*Three complaints with codes unreadable, therefore, a total of thirty complaints on SL84
CPB since November

As we get the tracking spreadsheets for our continued analysis, we can plug in these
complaints by order number. Unfortunately, we do not have the shift or machine code so
the closest we can come may be assigning some complaints to two orders, and in some
‘cases assigning some complaints to both machines involved. When the complaints arrive,
perhaps we can then pinpoint the machines and shift.

If any questions, please call. Thanks,

Tony
