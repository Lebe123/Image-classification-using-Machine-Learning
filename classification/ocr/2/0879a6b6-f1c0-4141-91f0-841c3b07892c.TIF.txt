ABSTRACT

‘The hypothesis that environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) increases risk for cardiovascular
disease (CVD) in nonsmokers has recently received attention because of two published
government reports. Epidemiology studies report that the relative risk for CVD
associated with actively smoking twenty cigarettes per day is 1.78. Active smoking
exposes the smoker to approximately 16 times the ETS concentration, and 100 to 300-
fold the total smoke dose, experienced by @ nonsmoker. These government reports
estimate the relative risk for ischemic heart disease in ETS-exposed nonsmokers at 1.30
(CALEPA) and 1.23 (SCOTH), despite the much lower smoke exposure. Platelet
aggregation is proposed as a plausible and quantitatively consistent mechanism to explain
this nonlinear dose-response anomaly. Herein, evidence is presented suggesting that this
low-dose hypothesis is inconsistent with the literature on the cardiovascular pathology of
active smoking, the physiology of platelets and with the results from a human exposure
chamber study.

INTRODUCTION

The development or exacerbation of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been called the
most scrious health effect allegedly associated with environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)
exposure in nonsmokers, ‘The California Environmental Protection Agency (CALEPA)
has estimated that approximately 47,500 CVD deaths occur in the U.S. each year due to
TS exposure [1]. The U.S. EPA’s estimate for U.S. lung cancer deaths associated with
ETSis 3,800 (2).

 

‘The magnitude of the epidemiological association between CVD and active cigarette
smoking is problematic for proponents of a causal association between ETS exposure and
CVD. Specifically, the relative risk (RR) of CVD in active smokers of twenty cigarettes,
per day (one pack) is reportedly 1.78 [3]. Recent relative risk estimates for CVD and

ETS include 1,30, as calculated by the California Environmental Protection Agency
(CALEPA) [1], and 1.23, as determined by the Scientific Committee on Tobacco and
Health (SCOTH) [4] in the U.K. According to these estimates, the CVD risk associated
with ETS exposure is approximately one-third of the CVD risk associated with actively
smoking twenty cigarettes per day.
