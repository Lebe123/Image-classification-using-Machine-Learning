Dear Mr. Big Tobacco Executive,

\just wanted to sy that think the way your_angry_cipartte company deceived the world really _chases_, and | dont
Understand how you can _run_with yourself Seling & hairy product lke cigarettes.

e.bad enough that you _monkays_at_R. Reynolds_know tht smoking your cigarettes caused cancer, and kept
selling them anyway, but then to be deceptive about what you knew and_then_try to cover it up is just plain _evil_;

Valeo waned to knew was t worth How many _smallbusinesgas_have you beon able to buy with lhe money
you've made addicting people to nicotine? How codld all of your_clowns_ ever make-up for the _60__years_of suffering
‘you've caused smokers and thelr families es you got _fithy_ rich hooking them on a deadly product?”

‘Just remember, in the end we _get_what we _give_.

May the lord have mercy on your pathetic _souls

 

Love_,_you bastards_and_theives_.
