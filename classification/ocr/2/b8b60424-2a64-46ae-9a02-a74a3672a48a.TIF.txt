Subject: YSP Asian Parent Print Approvals Next Week

Thave set up a few appointments next week to get Sr. Mgmt. approval on our
YSP Asian parent print executions. Here's the schedule:

Ellen Merlo: Monday, 2/7 @ 10:00
Nancy Lund: Tuesday 2/8 @ 4:00 (tent)
Mike Szymanezyck: Friday, 2/11@ 8:30
Steve Parrish: TBD

   

 

  

 

I'm pushing these approvals through next week because if we don't get them
through, Marti and I are pretty much gone after 2/11 for the next three weeks:
Jodi on vacation and Marti on relocation the weck of 2/14, then shoots from 2/21
to 3/6.

In the meantime, we will be looking at the layouts again to make sure the SGW
is prominent enough. The layouts are very simple, so we recommend leaving
the SGW at its current size and taking down the YSP/PMUSA identifier size.
No problem.

  

Additionally, we will get the Asian print readers
yesterda,
news pape'

ip information we talked about
T expect this information will be mostly qualitative--many of the
s are probably not audited.

 

 

Let me know if you have any issues with our plan for next weck. I know the in
Janguage work hasn't been screened yet by Legal. We'll incorporate any
necessary copy changes--overall I'm fecling pretty confident the work is in good
shape so I want to keep it moving.
