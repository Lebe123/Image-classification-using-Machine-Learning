55¢ per pack cigarette tax hike and comparable hikes in other tobacco
Vonaeos products. Although Clinton admitted that the chances of his cigarette
Leaf Bulletin 99-22 tax hike passing Congress were slim to none, Senate Minority Leader

‘Tom Daschle (D-SD) said a cigarette tax albeit a smaller one is still
salvageable. “Tthink the president acknowledged that maybe 55 cents
the Republicans may not be able to accept, but there's along way from one cent to 58 cents. And that is
still on the table and very much alive,” Daschle said (TW99-13).

Engle Ruling: On October 20% Florida's Third District Court of Appeals reversed its slo

g sum. Industry attorneys vigorously

objected telling the panel that a single: award would cause an “enormous amount of irreparable harm
tothe industry.” Analysts expressed surprise. The Negatives: Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst
David Adelman described the decision as “the worst outcome of the appeal; {and it] was the least likely
outcome.” Salomon Smith Bamey analyst Martin Feldman believes that the ruling will “substantially”
increase litigation risks for the industry. “It's hard to identify a simple series of events that would lead
toan industry victory,” said Feldman. “You are looking at a jury, that has already decided against the
industry, being asked ‘how much?” That prospect is tough.” Feldman also doubted the likelihood of
the Engle case being stripped of its class certification anytime soon. The Positives: Goldman Sachs
analyst Mare Cohen said that the “ruling was narrow in scope and leaves open opportunity for the
industry to pursue a separate appeal of the constitutionality of the Engle court's treatment of punitive
damages on substantive merits...” Legal sources, he added, “strongly believe that the Engle court is
going against FL statute and both US. Supreme Court and FL state court case precedent ...” Sanford
Bernstein analyst Bill Pecoriello suggested that if the appeals court and the Florida Supreme Court do
not significantly reduce a large punitive damage award and/or decertify the class, that the US.
Supreme Court will ultimately reject any punitive damage verdict. “This,” wrote Pecoriello, “will mark
the death of all tobacco class actions.” Stock Fallout: Tobacco stocks sank dramatically on the news.

12% each on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), and PM shares eventually hit a four-year low,

representing the largest fallin at least 19 years. Adelman said there is “fatigue” and “frustration”
among investors regarding the seemingly endless cloud of litigation. However, Cohen called tobacco,
stock price declines “an unwarranted reaction to the developments in the Engle case. ... we continue
to believe that this case will be resolved far more favorably than market trading implies.” A “far more
positive landscape” is on the horizon than the one investors currently envision. Further, he said his
contacts believe no tobacco company bond will be required before an appeal (TW99-43, Dow Jones
