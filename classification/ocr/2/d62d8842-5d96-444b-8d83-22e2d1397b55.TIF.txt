WW YORK (AP)--The maker of Winston and Canel cigarettes boosted its
wholesale

prices by about 4% Friday in a move that analysts said could add about a nickel
to the

retail price of a pack of smokes.

R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., the nation's second-biggest tobacco marketer,
inforned
its customers late Thursday that it was boosting its prices, effective Friday,
to offset
rising costs. It was the first increase in cigarette prices since April 1996.

Philip Morris USA, the biggest U.S. tobacco maker with brands like Marlboro
and
Virginia Slims, and other tobacco companies made no inmediate move to match the
price hike.

But analysts said they expected the industry would do so within days.

Enanvel Goldman, who follows the industry for PaineWebber, said the announced
increase came about a month earlier than expected, and he said Reynolds probably
moved to head off hoarding by wholesalers in anticipation of a price hike.

Goldnan estimated the increase in prices paid by wholesalers would result in
an
increase of about a nickel a pack in the retail price paid by smokers.

The retail price of cigarettes varies widely because of different levels of
state or local
taxes.

Reynolds spokeswoman Maura Ellis said her conpany's latest survey indicated
the
average national retail price of cigarettes was $1.74 a pack.

She said Reynolds boosted its charge to wholesalers by $2 per 1,000
cigarettes, which
amounts to an increase of 40 cents per carton and 4 cents a pack, But
wholesalers and
retailers then decide how much to add to their prices before the cigarettes
reach
consumers.

The increase was identical to the last increase 11 months ago.

Reynolds saw its share of the domestic tobacco market shrink to about 24.4%
last year
from 25.3% in 1995, according to the investnent firm Smith Barney. Philip
Morris,

Meanwhile, saw its share grow to about 48.3 from 47.14.

But Goldman said he doubted that the price increase would hurt Reynolds*
market
share because he expected other tobacco makers would match it.

‘'There is no reason for then not to,'t he said. ‘‘Their expenses are going up
and they
want to increase their level of profitability."

In addition to Winston and Camel, Reynolds makes Salem and Doral cigarettes as
well
as other brands.

In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Reynolds’ parent RIR Nabisco
Holdings
Corp. gained 25 cents @ share to close at $36.87 1/2 while Philip Morris was up
$2.75 a
