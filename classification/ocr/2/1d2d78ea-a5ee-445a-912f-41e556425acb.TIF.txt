Edith,

‘The note below from LBCo. indicates that they'll have '97 menthol volume for you by the
middle of next. As you'll recall, the UPC’s assigned for non-menthol smokers are also
assigned for menthol smokers, so this request necessitates LBCo. going in manually and
calculating volume off of the database.
