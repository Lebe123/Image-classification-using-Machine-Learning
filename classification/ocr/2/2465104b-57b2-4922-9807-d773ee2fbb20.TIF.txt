Message: Dear R.J Reynolds,

My wife and I have been avid smokers of Doral Lights 100's for over 15
years. We have tried other brands but never found any other that we
liked. Recently in our area The original Doral Lights have been replaced
by the new splendidly blended Doral Lights. I am here to tell you that we
do not like them at all. Its a shame that after fifteen years we will
once again have to find another brand. There is one store left in our
area that still carries the originals. Once they are out, we will be
moving on to other tobacco companies. 1 realize we are only two people
out of millions of smokers however, everâ€™ smokes ts (1

everal) hav i It was a bad choice to
replace a wonderful product rather than creating another line of that
product. Your consumers should be offered a choice

Extremely Dissastisified
