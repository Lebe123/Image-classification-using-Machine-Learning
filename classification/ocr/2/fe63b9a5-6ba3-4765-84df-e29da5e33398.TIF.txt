Subject: Circle K NA progress report

 

Team:

No surprise on this months report, through August we took a nose dive with Marlboro volume which
had a chain reaction on our CPW, and SOM. One bright spot was that the strategy of utilizing the
Flex in Arizona worked, as we did not experience SOM loss in our largest Region. We will have a
strong rebound in 4th Qtr with heavy promotional activity. Delivering proper execution at Retail
and preventing OOS will drive us into 2000,

Thanks
