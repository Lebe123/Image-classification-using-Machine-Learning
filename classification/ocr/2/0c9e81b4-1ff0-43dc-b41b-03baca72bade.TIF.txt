Dear Rick,
‘You have asked for a meeting with Ted and me (maybe others as well) o talk about what we do withthe website’, | am
not clear whether you want to talk about the speci suggestion fa into the NCL report or what we do about the web
site in general. Regarding the latter we had this topio on the Staff Meeting agenda twice but we oid riot Get f Te

‘Ted's comment as ‘not supportive'to a link in the PMUSA TEN page. In my opinion we should recommend a link to the
report but from a page where compensation is being addressed (T&N page, 7th paragraph). Whose responsibilty is it to
resolve this and come to an answer for Paula?

 

 

   

Regards,
Roger

Have you reached any conclusions regarding adding a link the NCI report? The site already contains a number of links to
public health authority views on T&N #s and descriptors. [think itis a fairly easy link to add. Here are the T&N pages:

Paula,
| must admit that | hadn't thought about it, Answering that question would require an answer to a more fundamental

question; namely, what purpose would such a ink serve?. The position that we take on the web site (trusting my
