Privileged and Confidential

Let me know what he said. You know my thoughts on this matter - the meeting was entirely premature; | thought it was
going o be postponed until PM USA developed a comprehensive business plan for this project. AS | discussed with you,
that plan should be developed by R&D and Leat, should be in writing and should be signed off on by both you and Hector.
We (Legal) cannet proceed with communicating with EPA unti a clear plan is developed: you will appreciate where I'm
Coming from -- PM cannot approach regulators with a plan that is not fully developed. ‘The same holds true of ULT. From
EPA perspective, | mentioned before that if EPA decides we need a permit there isa true risk that they wont have time at
this point to issué one for the 2004 crop.
