Rick and Jim - 'm sorry to do this to you but i've changed my mind on the military cassette,
don't think a price off with a bounce back is a great way to go. T thought we were offering a
cassette at retail. Also

with the reorg here and the many iniatives that have come on to the plate, I don't want to put
resources into micro markets. By copy of this memo to the Marlboro, Lam reminding the
whole team to include quantities for military when and wherever possible. Sorry.
