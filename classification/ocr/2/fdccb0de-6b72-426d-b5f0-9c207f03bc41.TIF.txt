Ken,
‘Thanks for your thoughtful reply. I've added it to the others. Also, thanks for your
comment about my role and your insight on the group's motivation; we're on the same
wavelength and that makes me feel good.

Harold

P.S. Could you stand a personal observation from "Harold?" He would caution about
‘over using your military experiences. Most haven't gone through what you have and may
not understand where you'te coming from. Specifically, someone overhearing only part
of the banter yesterday (when you said "Never reveal your weaknesses") might think
you're not a team player (that’s not a problem among folks who know you - like
yesterday). But he certainly wouldn't want anyone who isn't around you on a regular basis,
{0 hear something like this and have that misconception.

P.P.S. Now it’s "Crayton’s” tum. Keep in mind Harold wrote the above. I told him to
lighten up, especially given the situation yesterday in which easy banter and playfulness
among friends is SOP (isn't that a military abbreviation?)

P.P.P.S. How neat - Gary's ideas on "looking at things differently" captured all in one
body. What others may call “split personality,” I opt to call “enlightened thinking." What
can I say - perhaps Bill Cosby said it best when he immortalized his childhood buddy by
calling him “ole weird Harold.”

Ken, if any of the postscripts make sense to you, seck professional help immediately!!!
