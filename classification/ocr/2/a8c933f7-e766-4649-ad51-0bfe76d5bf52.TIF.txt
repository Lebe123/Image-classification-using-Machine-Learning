Mr. Zhou Kaiwen:

In response to your question, it willbe easier for our records if you refund out bank account, however, { do not
have the information at this time. | willbe in touch with you. There is an adeition to my request. Michael Watkins
‘was in touch with your office. He wil be participating n the Post Tour 2, but had already made arrangements for

his travel to Bejing. He was told to deduct $100.00 from tour fee. Since we wired you a total of $460.00, we are

also due a refund of $100.00. This brings the total of refund currently to $880.00. { wil forward to you the details

later

Regards,
Jo
