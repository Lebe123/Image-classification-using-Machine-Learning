‘Thanks so much, Andrais, for your kind comments, We have learned on SALEM to fully
leverage whatever we can to get the word out (smile). Seriously, I think itis important to
share information and successes with those who were involved in helping get it done and
that has certainly been the case with SALEM,

Take car.

Hi Ronda;

‘The preview of the Access ORB-< film, Q&A and the door prize was fantastic (the
“Tobaccoville employee winning the door prize will have the OA's BUZZing with
conversation) Also, sharing with the local RJR employces was a great idea and
encouraging WORD-OF-MOUTH which is the best advertisement (low cost)!!

The exposure, product and helping others will pay off for the SALEM Brand. It brings
such freshness!!!

Thanks for sharing with W-S.

Andrais
