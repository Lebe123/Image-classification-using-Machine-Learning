thanks. | agree that it looks good.

Thave a few comments,
1) Re review process, pis. send to me, and I'll fwd. to Marty at al. | would plan for atleast 3-4 days to review.

‘fm on vacation the week of 9/25. To start the review process, | suggest assembling the entire draft package after the 9/20
internal recommendation, rather than reviewing piecemeal. The presentation can then be updated re any outcomes of the
‘9/25 ASTM meeting.

2) As always, the entire presentation should be reviewed relative to the proposed licensing package. Ty, one particular
point to discuss with George is the level of information beyond the SOT posters.

3) Likewise, we should discuss the level of detail re future plans not directly related to compliance with whatever
performance standard NY eventually selects.

 

thanks
