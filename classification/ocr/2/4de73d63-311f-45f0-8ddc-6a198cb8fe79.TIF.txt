We received one product flaw complaint last week on Eclipse
Fire Falls out. This consumer did not ask for compensation
and did not appear to be upset. She was sent coupons as
appeasement. We also sent her a mailer so she can return
the product.

Please let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
donna walkup
