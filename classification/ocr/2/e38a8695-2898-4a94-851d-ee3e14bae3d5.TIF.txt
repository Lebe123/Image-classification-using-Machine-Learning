The February 1st download will be used to generate a brands list for Texas and
Minnesota for the calendar year 2000, Kevin, as discussed, you may want to review the
Minnesota report format from last year. We'll simply create the same report, but insert the
brands for 2000.

Let me know if there are questions,

â€˜Thanks,
