‘Subject: Harm reduction meeting - Sep 19-20
Sent: 8/30/00 10:20 PM Importance: Normal
‘The meeting on Harm Reduction has been scheduled for Sep 19 and 20 and will take place in the

Richmond area, ————

‘The purpose of the meeting is to bring together the ideas that we've been talking about that relate to harm
reduction so that we can make sure we have a reasonably coordinated effort and can begin planning,
projects and activities. One way of looking at this 's what do we really know because we have solid data,
from this what guidance can we give to product development folks today (or in the near future), and ther
whet do we need to know (including now to measure certain things) todo a better jb of harm feduction in
the future.
