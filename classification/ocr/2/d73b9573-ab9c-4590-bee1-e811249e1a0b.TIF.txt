Dear Frau Viol,

Poor Cologne just doesn't seem to have enough hotel rooms. | have no
problem staying in Bonn, Also Dr. Haussmann suggested that ! might want
to have dinner. Dinner is certainly not a requirement. | will be

landing in Cologne at about 19:10. If that is not too late, and ifit

is not inconvenient, | would welcome having dinner with someone. fit

Is a problem, | can always find something to eat

‘Thanks you as always. Best regards.

Ted Sanders
