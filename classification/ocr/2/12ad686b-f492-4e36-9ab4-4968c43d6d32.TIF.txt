Situation analysis

 

Dear Raymond,

{was not sure whether you would be on the cal of the planning team earlier today. So let mo share with you some
‘questions/thoughts on the 'WSA ETS/VTS Group Game Plan Summary, dated July 22, 1999). | wil refer to the bullets
numbered consecutively 1-82)

24: regarded as important by whom?
40: s this an extemal point (what does ‘external! mean? extemal to what?)

114: Why was the EU selected? Are these the best, worst, or mean values forthe worldwide survey?

14: Itmay be worth mentioning thatthe hospitality industry has expressed preference for set-regulations.

46-20: Who is ‘Competition’?

418: More publications on what?

46: I dont understand this point.

418: Again: who is the competition?

20: Seen by whom?

26: What does this mean - improve productivity? Of what? Of whom?

49-52: | would think that 'Lack or imitation of funds’ is another serious threat

55: One might consider to differentiate between short-term and long-term objectives. Business usually is more short-term,
solence more long-term orlented and managed.

63-82: | do not see airports being mentioned. Not importanvactive?

 

| hope I got the numbering right and these comments/questions are useful. Please let me know, if you need any
explanations.

Hope everything is fine in HK

Ken regards,
Roger
