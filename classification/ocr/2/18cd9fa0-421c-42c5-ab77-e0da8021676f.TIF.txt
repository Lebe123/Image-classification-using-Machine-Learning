Subject: ABT question?

 

â€˜As | understand it, 96-99% (depending upon who you read) of the monkey genome matches the human genome
exactly. Why then is it thatthe risk assessment safety factor published in CFR Vol 62, No 247, pg 67387 for the
dog-to-human

extrapolation is 2, while the monkeycto-man safety factor is 37 Even the rabbit factor is 2.5. Any thoughts?
