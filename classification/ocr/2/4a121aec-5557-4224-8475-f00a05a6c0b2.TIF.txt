Bill, per our agreement ‘rom last month (a result of Kirby's unofficial auait of the Document
Center). we have started rejecting document packages that do not have a sufficient
implementation plan. This has caused the expected angst armong folks who have been use to
geting ty wih oo ite or none at a). This not always a pleasant expenionce for uf DCA

‘would lke for this check to be part of the QSIC review so that we could catch tne problem:
before t hits us. 1s this possible? At the minimum, we expect the plan to outline who needs
the training, who is conducting the training, who is providing training materials, and when is
the training supposed to be conducted. Imiplementation plans could be a lot more than this,
but we seldom get even that much. What do you think?
