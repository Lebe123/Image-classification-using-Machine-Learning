“Test List for Ames.

 

Doar Michel, this looks good to me. This approach should avoid any major bias, in particular as

‘you do the 2 samples from one eubject on the same day. Please proceed, so we can soe the

Fesults asap. In order for me to see the importance of the Ames Investigations for other tals it

‘would be fine if you could extend the table with the 2 values you have determined for each
subject woud be great could Sor the results om the at 5 days andthe er 8 days as
wey comein.

Best regards
Hans:
