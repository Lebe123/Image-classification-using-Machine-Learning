RE: FV: 2001 TSRC review manuscript (57-01, #62-01),

 

though I'm not clear, my current guess would be that you should write the international afilation, without WSA. That
rellects the fact that you ara international employees, butit also is not clear about your relationship to WSA! hopefully we
will be clearing things tke this up in the near future,
