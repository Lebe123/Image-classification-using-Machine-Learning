Chuck has offered up either January 18 or 19th to the head of the editorial board. Despite her strong dislike for PM
(which she voiced in no uncertain terms), she is reaching out to the other members of the editcrial board to see if
there is any interest in meeting with you and Mike. They'll get back to us once they've discussed as a group.
