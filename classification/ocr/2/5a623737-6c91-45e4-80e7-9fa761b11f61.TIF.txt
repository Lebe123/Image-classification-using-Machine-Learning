DEAR RICK: FOLLOWING MY TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH YOU

 

YESTERDAY I SPOKE WITH SEVERAL OF OUR MANAGERS WHO HAVE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR

‘SOME OF THE REGIONS OF THE VARIOUS NATIONAL OIL COMPANIES,
‘SPECIFICALLY

CONOCO AND EXXON. CONOCO IS STILL NEGOTIATING AT REGIONAL
LEVEL WHERE PHILIP HAS AN EXCLUSIVE IN ALL REGIONS BUT ONE.
UNLESS WE ARE

WILLING TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT I FEAR THIS WILL CONTINUE. MY
NATIONAL

CONTACT HAS NO POWER OVER THE REGIONS AT PRESENT; HOWEVER HE
FEELS IF WE CAN

MAKE A BETTER OFFER THAN OUR LEVEL I HE CAN SI
TOTHE

REGIONALS. KEEP IN MIND LEVEL Il AT THE $140/MONTH FIGURE HAS
BEEN REJECTED

BY ALL THREE REGIONS IT HAS BEEN PRESENTED TO TO DATE. THE TULSA
REGION IS

BEING PRESENTED TO TODAY. CONOCO IS OF THE,

OPINION THEY CAN SELL PHILIP MORRIS ON A TWO AND TWO SCENARIO
LIKE WE

PRESENTED TO EXXON. LAST YEAR WHEN FIORI WAS DEALING WITH
CONOCO THEY ASK.

FOR A MILLION DOLLAR BONUS FOR A NATIONAL CONTRACT. FOR
OBVIOUS REASONS WE,

DECLINED.

THE PROGRAM

 

HERE IS MY THOUGHT. NUMBER ONE I STRONGLY FEEL WE NEED TO HAVE
PRESENCE IN

THESE CHAINS. I WOULD LIKE OUR APPROVAL TO REPRESENT LEVEL I
MONIES AND

9%lb Opees
