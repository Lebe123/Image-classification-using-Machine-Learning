I've heard from several of your lobbyists on the idea of a
proactive initiative to support reasonable restaurant
smoking policies.

Since many of you have been on the road, this note will let
each of you know what your guys are saying... I'm not
reporting details here, just the topline. (When I put a
comment in quotation marks, that doesn't mean it's a
verbatim comment. I'm just trying to sum up their point of
view in a sentence or two.)

Phil McDonald believes there may be an opportunity to
include reasonable restaurant smoking language in a bill
next year.

He is quite certain an initiative would not be a good idea.

"You would need to deliver 200,000 signatures by July of
2000, and the first financial report would come out in
January of 2000. When the first financial report hits, the
issue will become the tobacco companiesâ€™ role in the
initiative, and you're radioactive."

Phil is very interested in obtaining some model language or
some options he can offer when he faces an unreasonable
proposal from the other side.
