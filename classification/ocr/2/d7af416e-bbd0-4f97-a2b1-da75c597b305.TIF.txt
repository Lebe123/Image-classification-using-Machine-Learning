Hi Jordan,

As promised, attached is the schematic of our attraction at WWE's Axxess
weekend, Our logo signage will be beneath the fantasy play by play
graphic, 2" x 8'=~prominent positioning.

In a positive turnaround, WWE is now able to accomodate display of our
creative -- (they had thought the amaller venue this year would prevent
this feasibility). Enlarged posters (approx 2'x4') of our creative will
be placed on easels -- on each end of the display area. We forwarded
mounted posters we had available from a previous event for use in this
venue -- 1 each of Comic BookWoman and Eggshell.

 

Additionally, WWE will be distributing 8 1/2" x 11" flyers for us with
the Comic Book Woman creative. They decided not to move forward with
the initial flyers that had the listing of the play-by-plays on the
back. Instead, the "Play by Play" list I emailed to you on Wednesday
will be enlarged to poster size -24"x 36" and be displayed instead.
They will use our traditional buttoutnow.com logo treatment for this
poster, instead of the special treatment I had requested if the flyer
had remained at ite current size.

our tv spot "Roonmates" will air on-screen for each play by play
Participants prior to their play by play commencing.

WWE hag also said that if we would like to provide them with some
branded YSPP tshirts, the people manning the play by play attraction
would be happy to distribute them to the kids. If you're interested, we
can decide if we'd like to give 25 or 50 for each session--to the first
25 or 50 kids per session (3 sessions a day]. We have plenty of tshirts
available for this, if you'd like to take advantage of this.

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.

Thank you.
