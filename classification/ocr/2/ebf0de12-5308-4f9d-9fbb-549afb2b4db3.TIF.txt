i Answer

 

Tom Frederick asked me to get your final ok ASAP ~ Today is the deadline to answer the
Venable complaint (Carlucei) in Hillsborough County that Tom mentioned in our weekly call
last Wednesday. As he told us, itis substanially the same as the previous complaints so there
should not be anything controversial in our answer. ‘Thanks
