Subject: RE: Website Info Line Update

first of ali want to send them to the pm usa website, not the corporate site, so we are giving them the wrong web address.
‘secondly, | thought we were going to find gut what issue they were interested in. we are not going to do individual folders.

ware ging to do one general press kt ke foider which would include prs mission and values a set pleca. then We
will do individual one pagers on each of our issues and we would pick and choose which to send to each consumer based

‘on their inquiry.
‘otherwise iam okay with this and the mailer, which i already had approved from s. piskor. thanks.
