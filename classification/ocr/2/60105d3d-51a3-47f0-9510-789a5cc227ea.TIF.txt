Jennifer,

I met with Adam Haber of NGN (Next Generation Network). This is the company that has placed
ty monitors at retail to run a series of 10 second spots (without audio) as well as the weather, the
time and sports scores.

| think this medium shows promise, particularly for our new work in 2000 to help prevent 3rd party
sales. It could also make sense for our parent messages as well as tween messages in those
locations that are near schools where kids shop.

''d be interested in your take on the effectiveness and efficiency of this medium, so can you
please give him a call? Adam can be reached at 212-931-8107.

thanks.
