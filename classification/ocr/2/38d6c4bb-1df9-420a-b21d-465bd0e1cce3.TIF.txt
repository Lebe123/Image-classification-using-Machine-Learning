I you decide to have someone from Lazerton fly out to ty and fix the video
james in market they wil need to goto Dallas and Pitsburgh. Memphis and
bany have sent their games back because it was my opinion at the time they

sent them back, which Was before we had discussed this option, that they

‘were beyond repair by our GMMSs in market. However, both maikets are stil

witnout games. Both ofthese markets end ther Ranch promotional window the

week of May ‘st. | have not found out if Lazertron fixed the game in San

Francisco, but! will let you know when I find out more information.

Thanks.

Jason
