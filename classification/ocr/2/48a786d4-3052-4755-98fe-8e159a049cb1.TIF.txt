Shuanise will be addressing a national group of Black County Officials in
Birmingham, AL on May 14, How difficult would it be to provide numbers (even
a topline analysis) of the impact that federal tax increase would have on AL
counties? J also think that the information you are compiling for other
states could be useful at this meeting. If you come across good example of
county or Local government aid that would be reduced if cigarette volume
declines, we will share with shuanise. Thanks
