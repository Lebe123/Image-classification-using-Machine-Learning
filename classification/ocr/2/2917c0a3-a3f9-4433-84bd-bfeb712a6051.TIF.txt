Even forwarded to me Michael's note re: requested translations of selections from the PM website for
Poland, Czech Rep., Hungary, israel and Turkey. Could we please schedule a call tomorrow to discuss
‘coordination of these and other transiations for CEMA countries (both selections and more complete
versions)?

 

Y We should agree on a mechanism to ensure intemal review by appropriately bilingual CA and Legal
colleagues;

Y% We should include Arabic and coordinate with Bisharah Baroudi (whom | believe is in Dubai this
week).

Could you please let me know what time would be convenient?
Thanks,

Jamie
