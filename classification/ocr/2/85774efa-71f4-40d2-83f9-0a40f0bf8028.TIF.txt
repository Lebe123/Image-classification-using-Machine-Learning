Subject: FW: MES memos:

Hi Jamie-

‘As you can see there are 4 versions of the MES Mailing outlined 2s follows:

41) The Intranet deskdrop to all PM USA Employees who have access to computers.
2) The intranet deskdrop to the Fied Sales Forco—we specifically call attention to the fact that they wil be getting the
‘brochure in the mail as they don't have an office to pickup brochures.

3) FSF Mailing: This isthe same letter as in point #2 above, however, we need to mail them the brochure to FSF
‘employees wo gel the electronic deskdrop and so we have altered the lang, to say, "Enclosed is a copy of the new YSP
booklet.

44) The intranet deskdrop which must be posted on the bulletin boards in the plant communities for employees wio
‘computers.

‘As we moved forward wi the deskdrop details, we realized that a single letter (what you originally approved) would have
alienated a large number of employees and as such, the minor modifications have been made wl impacting content.

 

Let me know if you have any questions,
Eric Ostern,
‘Manager, Youth Smoking Prevention Programs
