Keith-

The Coalition for Responsible Tobacco Retailing, together with the Wisconsin Merchants
Federation, Wisconsin Association of Convenience Stores, Tavern League of Wisconsin,
Wisconsin Grocers Association, Wisconsin Restaurant Association, Wisconsin Association of
Distributors, Wisconsin- National Federation of Independent Business and the Wisconsin
Sheriffs and Deputy Sheriffs Association will be sponsoring training sessions in Wisconsin.

Retailers welcome and appreciate this opportunity as it helps them and their employees know and
understand the minimum-age sales law, learn how to handle a minor or an abusive customer,
how to check for ID and much more.

We appreciate the FSF's past support to promote We Card. Although we usually provide the field
with six weeks advance notice, the Coalition needed extra time to nail down the details of these
training sessions. Therefore, to give you as much time as possible to distribute flyers in stores, |
have enclosed a PDF of the fiyer so that you can print out your own copies to distribute, If
however you prefer, we can send flyers for TSMs and SAMs to hand out to their independent and
chain accounts. If yes, please let me know via e-mail, quantity of flyers you need and addresses
of where they should be sent (include phone number). Multiple destinations are fine.

The Coalition and their Wisconsin partners will also be sponsoring training sessions via satellite
‘on October 16 in cities statewide. | have also attached a PDF of the videoconferencing flyer so
that you are able to print out copies to distribute these as well. We can also send flyers for
TSMs and SAMs to hand out. If yes, please let me know via e-mail, quantity of flyers you need
and addresses of where they should be sent (include phone number). As above, multiple
destinations are fine.

In advance, Thanksil!
