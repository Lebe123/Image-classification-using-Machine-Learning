Subject 2 Use of denatured alechol in the production of menthol cigarettes

 

This is to outline the option to continue the use of denatured alcohol for the production of
‘menthol cigarettes for all markets, as discussed with Dr. R. Suber on Sep. 4,'96,

Background

SRA requested and Marketing concurred to remove denatured alcohol as a carrier for flavour
systems, for those markets where the use could cause a PAJPR issue

Menthol cigarettes developed by R&:D Europe contain a complex mixture, resulting in a
smoother and sweeter smoke, preferred by European smokers. This flavor system can,
however, not be dissolved in any other carrier without going to extreme dilutions.

Options

‘Modification of menthol flavor system allowing the removal of denatured alcohol.

This will change smoking characteristics.

Program is under way, samples are sent to Geneva for internal R&D assessment and

presentation to Marketing,

* Since menthol brands are the only ones to continuc to require denatured alcohol, SRA feels
comfortable to allow its continuous use. In other words, itis not scen as a risk to advise
outside parties that for some specific brands denatured alcohol is essential as a processing
aid.

 

Action
* R&D Intemational needs to decide whether option 2 is internally acceptable.
Pro: No product change.
Con: There will be menthol brands with and without denatured alcohol as carrier.
This will, however, be impossible to be measured on the finished goods.

 

Could you please advise on how to proceed. If option 2 is chosen, the work agi
option 1 could be discontinued,

 

‘Thank you for a quick reply.
