Sorry it has taken me so long to mail these to you - hope
it hasn't caused a problem.

Peggy has indicated that these are the documents she sent
to MN reporters in response to the document that was
mentioned in court yesterday (I think). She indicated this
is one of the privileged documents and we will not address
the document itself. If you get a media call, you must be
very clear that you have not seen and are not speaking to
the documents, but that this subject has come up before and
here's the statement we issued previously.
