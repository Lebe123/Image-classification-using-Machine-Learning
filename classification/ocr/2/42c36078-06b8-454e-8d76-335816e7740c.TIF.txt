Merit Cup Promotion - Feedback

Gordon, Rebecca

Bucciarelli, Rick; Rodriguez, Mike

Rebecca,

Below is some feedback regarding the Merit Cup Promotion:
Chains involved:

+ Fina - 46 stores
+ Food N Fuel - 31 stores

+ PDQ- 21 stores
Feedback:

+ Soda/cup portion was not received well by customers or store.

+ 40¢/2 packs was OK, however, not recommended to be used in conjunction with the cup
portion (perceived that the cup deminished the effect that the 40¢ offer had),

+ Program not recommended to be offered again,
‘At this time, the account Fina is relunctant to participate in Minneapolis buy down.

If you would like additional information, please call. Thanks! Laurie
