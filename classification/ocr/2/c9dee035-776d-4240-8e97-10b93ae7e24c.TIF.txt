Subject: Communications Plan

 

I think thie captures most of it. Please take a look and let me know what you
think. There obviously needs to be some thought given to longer term
plans/strategies.

Some of the questions I've identified may already be answered and I missed them;
stuff to resolve at the conference call/meeting this morning.

After we've thrashed this around a little, I suggest we send to meeting
participants prior to the meeting.

â€˜Thoughts?
