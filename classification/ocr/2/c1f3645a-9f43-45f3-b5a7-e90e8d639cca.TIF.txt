Reynolds Tobacco Lauds Legal Victory in Minnesota Class Action

In another important legal victory for the tobacco industry, a federal court in Minnesota has
denied cenification of a class-action suit secking smoking cessation and medical monitoring
programs for smokers and former smokers in Minnesota.

“Federal courts have unanimously rejected certification of tobacco class actions,” said Thomas P.
McKim, assistant general counsc! of RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Company. “The ruling marks the
10” time that a federal court has rejected this type of case since 1997. We are very pleased that
sound legal reasoning, as well as judicial common sense, have once again prevailed.”

In denying certification in Janet Thompson et al. v. American Tobacco Company, Inc. et al., the
USS, District Court for the District of Minnesota noted: “in the present case this analysis reveals
that Piaintiffs’ Complaint is riddled with individual questions that predominate over questions
‘common to the class.”

In its 26-page opinion, the Court also said:

'* “Plaintiffs argue that this case can be decided without regard to the conduct or condition of
Plaintiffs. In other words, Plaintiffs seek to avoid any question as to their own personal
responsibility in this matter by shifting focus to the conduct of Defendants. Although
establishing that Defendants’ conduct was fraudulent is necessary to the determination of this
claim, the conduct and condition of each Plaintiff must also be considered. Each time the
conduct or condition of Plaintiffs arises, an individualized inquiry must be undertaken. The
first such instance is proof of individual injury. Its clear that in order to sustain this lawsuit
Plaintiffs must have suffered some injury as a result of Defendants’ conduct.” (page 18)

 

* “Plaintiffs contend that proof of injury can be established on a class-wide basis without
engaging in individualized inquiries of each Plaintiff. Defendants argue that both addiction
and increased risk of disease cannot be proven unless an individualized inquiry is undertaken.
‘The Court agrees with Defendants.” (page 19)

 

* “Therefore, in onder to prove injury in this case, each Plaintiff must establish an addiction to
cigarettes. With a class of approximately 700,000 individuals, the assessment necessary to
make such @ finding would be impracticable and unmanageable and would certainly
predominate over questions common to the class.” (page 21)
