Dear RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co.,

{Ihave been a Winston smoker for 32 years. Ihave smoked Winston Light 100s
‘Box brand for most of my adult ife. | did not begin smoking until age 18,

‘enjoy smoking & have since I began many years ago. | will contin
smoking.

 

 

{1am outraged st 2 government who taxes a legal product tothe hit while not
holding other substances such as alcohol, beer & the lke to the same
standards

|1am also outraged atthe litigation against the tobacco companies,
‘especially by individuals. Why canit people take responsibil fr their
‘own actions? No one forced anyone to smoke or continue smoking,

‘The US government & our citizens should have leamed from the Prohibition Act
thatit does NOT work. You cannot legislate what habits are acoeptabl,

‘Thank you for a product which | enjoy & plan to continue enjoying, as long as.
the government doesn't overtax me to the point I can no longer afford to
‘smoke, which is their obvious intention,

Regards,
Sally Huntley
NI
