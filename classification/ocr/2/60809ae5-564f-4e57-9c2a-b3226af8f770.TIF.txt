New Technologies is looking at ways to reduce PAHSs in smoke. One approach that appears to hold some promise
involves the use of Zn. Before they get to heavily involved in this research, they have asked if there are any tox issues
with Zn that would warrent stopping this type of research. Please let me know your opinion. Please note | am not
‘asking (at this point) your approval of Zn, but rather your opinion as to whether there are any significant toxicological
‘concems involving Zn. Thanks.
