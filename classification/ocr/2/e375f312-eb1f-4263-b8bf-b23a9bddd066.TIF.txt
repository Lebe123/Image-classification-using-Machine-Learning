This is my first pass at putting together the materials you gave me. Its shorter than what
most of you provided, but all they want at this time is ttle and objective (so I still
probably have more here than they want). I'll keep the originals for later, because we
know they/ll coming back. Please look over your sections and let me know if we need to
change anything

Jack, Tl add your stuff where marked when you get it to me. You can see the final format
here.

Thank you! I need to get this to Jeff by tomorrow morning.
