Chad, Lisa, Robin and Kelly--

 

 

‘Mar00 KDS.XLS.

March is ready to go! Enclosed is the latest KDS, you will find the store lists, and the
EPB Tool on the NT server in the Region 5 folder under the following path on your PC
computer:

- Double click the shortcut to the JRCN...

- Double click on 1999-2000 Promotions

- Double click on March 2000

- Double click on Region 5

Please be aware that:

+ there is a Master Direct Accounts List and Tax Rate Database in the Preferences
folder in the loadset, so you will not need to copy your preferences folder into the
March EPB tool as you have done in the past.

‘* you will need to copy over the subjobber list from February into the Preferences
folder because we did not receive that data in time to populate the spreadsheet

‘* since you will be creating worksheets for revenue prebooking only (there are no
product promotions for March), you will need to combine the two store lists (S5x
2909-00RJ and S&x 2909-00WU) into 1 master list so that your organizations can
prebook for all accounts.

* you will not need to run your ALLINDEPENDENTS and ALLCHAINS lists through
‘ADS2 bic the Bridge has provided them for you in the form of the "0" lists (ie. S5x 0
CH criteria).

* you do not have an allocation template since the worksheets are for revenue
prebooking only. I will send these to you at a later date.
