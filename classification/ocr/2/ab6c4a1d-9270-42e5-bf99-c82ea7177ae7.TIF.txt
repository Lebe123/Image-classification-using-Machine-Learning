‘Steve, What brand items are you interested in being reported here??
Please let me know this. Also we do not have access to the RJR contract
information that you referred to here. MSA does receive an SIS tape from
RUR each week, however, that information is not on our tapes. (We only
receive limited SIS information from you, not everything on SIS.)

Please get back to me on the brand list and also what kind of spreadsheet
format woud you ke?" Anything special here ornot?? Let me know
