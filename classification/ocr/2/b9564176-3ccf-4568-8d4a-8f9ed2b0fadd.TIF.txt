David -

am copying this to both Glenda and Sheryl. My possibly inaccurate memory

is that Sheryl will be the lead dog on this, but Tm not sure that is
correct,

 

Here are some items forthe weekly. Note I am out of the office tomorrow,
Friday, and have asked others in Public Affairs to forward anything they may
have t0 you

© Public Affairs is working with the Environmental Department on a
project to test indoor air quality through CIAR (Center for Indoor Air
Quality). The goal is to show that the current ASHRAE standards, when
followed, are sufficient to insure adequate indoor air quality. Target
environments are the restaurant and gaming industries.

‘The Las Vegas Restaurant Association has helped us identify and secure a
test location. Mirage properties have recommended we use one of their
locations, Treasure Island, forthe casino test. Everything appears to be
moving ahead, and testing should take place in mid-March, The Mirage
properties are among the largest, most visible, and professionally run
operations in the industry, so we are quite pleased they are willing to work
with us,

© A meeting is scheduled to take place February 20 with Public Affairs

and Frank Fanrenkopf. Fahrenkopf is the director of the American Gaming
Association, and is a former national chairman of the Republican Party.

‘The purpose of the meeting is to solicity Fahrenkop{'s advice on how to

put together a seminar and training program on Indoor Air Quality for casino
‘operators. We will ask him if his organization would be willing to provide
any assistance, including potentially participating in the seminar.
