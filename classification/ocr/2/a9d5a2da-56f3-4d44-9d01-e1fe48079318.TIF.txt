Subject: TEMPLATE REVISIONS

‘As you know we recently checked a lot of documents out of EDMS in order to put these documents into the new
‘template format. Doug Miller says that we can bypass having 2nd approval signatures on these DCO's as long as you
agree to sign these DO's. In other words, we normally have 2 signatures on Administrative Changes to DCO's. In
this case, we would only have one and thal would be yours.

Ifyou are in agreement with this, please forward this e-mail on to Doug with your OK on the e-mail
