Dear Matt: It looks as though Monday next week will not work for our
Australian colleagues. As they are in the midst of OB presentations, I may not
hear an alternative schedule for a day or so. I have asked thon to suggest
convenient times for our collective consideration. I doubt, however, it will
be before mid-week next week. If a convenient time can be arranged within chat
time frame, we may have to proceed without Roger Walk, who will be in India,
returning to the office next Friday.

E11 let you know what looks possible as soon as I learn more.
Regards,
Mark P. Friedman
