Washington State Retail Script
2/12/96

I'm calling on behalf of a group of concerned retailers with an important
message. There's a bill before the Washangton State Senate that would be @
major problem for your business if it passed.

 

This bill, called $86457, sets up unreasonable and unnecessary restrictions on
tobacco product merchandising. It is one of the most intrusive bills ever,
giving government bureaucrats new authoraty over your business.

in fact, for the first time, state bureaucrats would be given the right to make
rules that affect your tobacco merchanidising. Right now, at least, your state
legislators have authority over these bureaucr: But if $8645? passes,

unelected bureaucrats will have the full authority, not your elected officials.

 

And with full rvle-making authority, there is no telling what kind of
regulations will be next.

 

Please protect your oun business and help stop this bill today. Your state

senator is on a key committee that will vote on this bill within

the next two days. That's why it's urgent that you leave a message for Senator
orge hin to vote against SB6457, the tobacco regulation bill.

IÂ£ you'd like to call and leave that message right now, I cen connect you
directly inte the senator's office _ and at no cost to you. Is that OK?

Wow the next voice you hear will be in Senator office. when the phone
is answered, give your name and hometown and ask to leave a message for Senator
Then ask your Senator to vote against BB6457, the tobacco regulation

 

 

 

bill.

Thanks for your tine.
