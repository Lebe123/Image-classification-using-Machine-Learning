We have had a number of discussions about RDRN and testin

ts effectiveness, A
couple of points. The Woodbridge study looks at program like "We Card” and not
RDRN. Second, we are doing a study on the effectivness of our PSAs but 1 am not saying
we should volunteer that information. Third, J am willing to listen to proposals to study

 

RDRN, so if you want to give me some ideas, let's hear them qui

Barnaby called end of last week re: Woodridge, Il (which he's visited), and youth
smoking programs in general. We had a long conversation, with his major sticking point
being why we can't test RDRN for its effectiveness. If we can test advertising for its
effectiveness, then why not RDRN, he asked. Told Herb it killed me to do so, but the best
example I could give him was Winston: we test ads, they come out great. We test
product, and it's favorable to atleast at parity. I's performance: a landslide over the past
decade, While he concedes the point that testing may not turn into performance, he's still
hung up over this and firmly believes that a test cell could be constructed to test program
effectiveness.

 

We discussed it again today, along with CDC research underway on why Black youth
smoke less than white, and he caught me by surprise saying he just got a note from JWJ.
He says Jim is looking at socially responsible corporate activities (did 1 get that right?)
and he's going to write him back. If you see/talk to Jim, Bamaby was obviously pleased
to hear from him,
