I've just re-read Philip Hilt's letter to Mattha Perske. Has she responded? If
0, how? Tf not, we should encourage her to, staxting out with the fact that

she is 4 non-smoker, not a menber of any snokers' rights croup (assuming she
isn’t) and has no relative employed by a tobacco company. Then we should
provide her with a very reasoned attack on the science (since that is what Kilts
says he is interested in debating; both EPA risk assessment and Fonthan study
justifying OSHA 1AQ zegulation) and a pointed xeprimand for degrading CRS. I
wonder if Hilts' knows that it was Henry Waxman (and Wendell Ford) who requested
the study?

I've alzeady spoken wich Matt Repp and put a plan in motion to get Hilts’ letter
to the CRS authors. We have a very good case to make on the science, especially
now that we have the abortion and EMF issues on the front pages, and Marthe is a
great ambassador. Your thoughts?
