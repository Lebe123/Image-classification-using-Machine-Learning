SGR and Ben's group support the National Hispanic Caucus of State Legislators. We
have a good relationship with New York Senator Efrain Gonzalez, who is president. He
has an excellent relationship with the 19 person federal caucus. I believe it is worth a shot
speaking to him regarding a reach out to the white building.

Although we will have to check this, 1 believe Hispanics have a strong presence at the
retail level---this might be a good handle. kw
