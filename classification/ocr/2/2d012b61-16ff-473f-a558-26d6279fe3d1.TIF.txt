SUBJECT: Establish a Specification For Upper Reject Limit On % Stem Content
For UTUGP2

OBJECTIVE: To review and update specifications on % Stem Content for UTIGP2 at
CRES Tobacco.

BACKGROUND: Referencing Procedure Note 94-11R3, an upper limit of 0.5% stem
content for the UTI product produced by CRES Tobacco Company at 605-11 was
recommended. The 0.5% upper limit specification was based on historical Cardwell
Test Method data. A more sensitive Cardwell Stem Test Method has been evaluated
which gives better definition of stem content. An investigation/review of Historical (over
time) QA capabilities data (CP & CPK data) using the new test method has been
completed and utilized as a basis for developing % Stem Content upper reject limit.

PRODUCT IMPACT: Since no process change is being implemented, there should not
be any negative impact and should provide a higher quality product because of the
more sensitive test method.

PRODUCT DISPOSITION: Quip out of spec material and re-run through the process.

RISK ASSESSMENT: We do not see any risk associated with the proposal at this
time, in fact, the more sensitive setup of the Cardwell Test Method will provide a more
consistent product.

RECOMMENDATION: It is recommended that this specification be accepted by the
PAC Committee. This procedure note will be reviewed in light of process capability
upon the completion of a 90 day review period.
