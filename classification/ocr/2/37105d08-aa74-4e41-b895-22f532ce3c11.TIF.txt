suspended fies

 

Brandt,

Hosea Glenn, the previous Purchasing Manager in Louisville made a decision to suspend all 1998 Louisville standing and
purchase orders based on his interpretation of a memo dated 2/3/98 from Bill Lynch. The memo in essence stated that PM
USA has received a court order requiring tho preservation of document containing information rolevant to manufacturing
methodology, testing, marketing in the United States, sales in the United States and/or composition and properties of
tobaceo, tobacco products, paper, filters or any other materials contained in, relating to, or used in the manufacturing,
testing, marketing in the United States, sale in the United States and/or composition and properties of tobacco and
‘Tobacco products.

Ithas come to my understanding that these files must be held in suspension until released by Legal. | do not feel that
100% of the 1996 files should be holdin suspension as some can and should be disposed of under the normal records,
retention schedule, Who should | contact to get the suspension led itis determined that certain records do not apply to
tne above criteria?
