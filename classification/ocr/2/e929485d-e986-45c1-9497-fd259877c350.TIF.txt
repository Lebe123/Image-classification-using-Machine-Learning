‘on friday afternoon around 4 pm est, a youth group from mississippii may try to call
andy. glenda goodman is bringing both of you a copy of the letter they sent. We
responded to their letter through overnight mail wednesday night. we don’t know what
number they might use so they may get the answering machine,

If by chance you get them on the phone, I would suggest the following:

Mr. Schindler is not available. He did get your letter and cd and has responded by Ictier
which your organization should have received Thursday.

‘They may try to stay on the phone or ask you some questions. I would simply try to exit
as quickly as you can.
