RE NISTITC testing

 

Jerry called me this AM. Dick Gann has informed him that resus may be released by tha FTC
‘some time next weok. Gann di not discuss the actual data,

‘Also, Gann said that NIST plans to reimburse PM forthe foam that PM provided for the tests,
given lack of commercial avaiiabity. If thelr preference is to pay for the foam, I think we should
‘accommodate them. Ty, ps. let Bill Dwyer know so he can work out details w/ Finance. suggest
that Bill work wi Linwood Sykes.
