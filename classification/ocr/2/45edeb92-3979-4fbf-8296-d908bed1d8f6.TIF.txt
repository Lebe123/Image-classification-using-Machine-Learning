Attachment

Discussed situation ("Problems in Disbursements Accounting with paying Sale’s office
expense invoices") on 12/7 with Disb (Dorothy Henley and Joyce Leonard) and Sales
Finance (Andi Bellis). The northeast sales region where complaints arc mainly from is
represented by Don Fitzgerald who is not available until sometime Friday at the earliest.

Andi asked me to not schedule a meeting for all parties to discuss until she and her future
replacement Rebecca Fulton have a chance to talk to Don Fitzgerald first. Andi talked to
someone who is at the ongoing Sales meeting where complaints were expressed, and said
that they were stated as generalities - she is going to ask for specifics and any suggested
changes. Andi said her preliminary feelings are that these will probably be mostly the
same old complaints ("I don't think we should have to code invoices", "RR isn't paying
vendors quickly”, "Odd size invoices are hard to fax", etc.) she has heard since the old
“TPS" system for paying sales office expense invoices was replaced months ago with the
Disbursements Accounting system.

‘The old “TPS " system was replaced because of serious control weaknesses that were
costing the Company money. Some of the problems with the old system were:
‘overpayments, duplicate payments, field sometimes paid balances rather than invoices,
vendor master set-up, payments to vendors in 2 days regandless of terms, retention of
invoices for 7 years in sales offices, no BEO reporting, and no 1099 reporting.

Currently invoices are received in the field, ledger-coded, approved, and faxed to
Disbursements for payment. Perhaps there is room for improvement in the process; 1 am
aware that consolidation of bills by vendors is currently under discussion in Disb
Accounting.

In summary, I expect to know more after Andi and Rebecca meet with Don Fitzgerald.
‘We will meet with Disb if necessary and will keep you informed.
