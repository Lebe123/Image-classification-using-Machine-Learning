Tim,

‘The results from the first two production runs of H613 and D637 on C&C line 4 using the
new Zenith pump,

indicates statistically that both the Batch Report % Difference in Top Dressing and the
Standard Deviation of the

ifference between Top Dressing Flow Actual and Top Dressing Flow Setpoint are better
than the original top

dressing delivery system.

‘The Top Dressing Flow Rate Standard Deviation during the H613 Blend using the Zenith
pump was
2.25 versus an average 2.76 using the original system. Also, the D637 run showed an

improvement
in top dressing flow standard deviation of 2.49 versus a 3.31 average.

Next Steps:

1,) Continue to monitor regular Top Dressing runs on C&C line 4. Note, there
are no additional regular runs scheduled this week,

2.) Address any issues production has with top dressing change over during a run.
3.) Continue to monitor the filter before the Zenith pump.

4.) Disassembly the Zenith pump after several regular top dressing runs and
check for any signs of excessive wear,
