‘The session was largely conducted by Mike Pertschuck of the Advocacy Instutute. He was introduced by Mike
McGinnis, senior consultant at the Robert Woods Johnson Foundation and a resident scholar at NRC.

‘According to Pertschuck, there are four possible scenarios regarding the settlement:

41. Worst Case: Congress starts with the weakest bill and the tobacco
industry errodes it

2. Limited Possibility: intial hearings begin to address the issue. Any of the

several grand juries could come back with an indictment of fraud or coruption
‘against the tobacco industry. This could make public opinion and media coverage even more biased against the

industry, forcing Congress fo take more severe action.
3. More Likely: Congress splits the difference in the existing bills, creating a compromise bil
4, Possible: Nothing happens due to conflicts between Republicans and Democrats.

‘According to Pertschuck, i the activist groups want success, they should emulate the tactics of the 1960s and
1970s auto safety issue; gain the media advantage and move public opinion, which in turn, moves Congress.

 

 

Pertschuck also discussed fear of a black market as a result of raising cigarette prices.

He also said that damage to the tobacco industry will ocour ifthe papers being turned over uncover fraud and
corruption, This will result in a public outcry that would encourage a severe deal

He stressed that a broad public outcry is he mast important strategy aginst the tobacco Indust. I this doesnt
‘occur, he believes Congress won't push the deal against the tobacco industry.
