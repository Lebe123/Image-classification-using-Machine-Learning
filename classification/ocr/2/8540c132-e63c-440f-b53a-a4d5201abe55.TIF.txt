Naney,

Thanks for inviting me to the meeting, which | would have enjoyed, had | been able to attend, All of MIP
management was at an offsite for the last two days.

Coincidentally, yesterday Jeff Slagle and I were discussing direct mail and tossing a few ideas around.
Please consider inviting me to any future meetings.

Thanks.

David
