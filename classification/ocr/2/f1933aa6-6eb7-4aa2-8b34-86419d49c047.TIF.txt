Statement in Response to Dr. Kessler
Subcommittee on Health and the E

 

's Appearance before U.S, House of Representati
vironment, Committee on Energy and Commerce

  

June 21, 1994

 

IL was apparent today that nicotine levels in cigarettes and the use of ammonia in processing tobacco
are of great interest to the Food and Drug Administration, When they visited RJ. Reynolds
Tobacco Company facilities andl talked to our sta this spring, the FDA stall did not ask about our
use of ammonia, Had they, or anyone clye, asked we would have been glad to tell them that:

 

  

Ru. Reynolds Tobacco uses only & minuscule amount of ammonia as a processing agent in only
‘one aspect of its production ~ the formation of reconstituted sheet tobacco,

# We use such low amounts of ammonia, that none of it remains in the final sheet product

+ Ammonia occurs naturally in tobacco, and the amount found in smoke is the same in sheets
processed with or without ammonia,

+ In fact, our analysis of the nicotine in smoke or the transfer rate into smoke indicate there is no
Gifference between sheet tobacco made with or without the ammonia processing agent

   

+ As Dr. Kessler’ statement indicates, the result of using ammonia as a processing agent is to
reduce the sugar content in tobacco, which smoothes out the taste.

+ In addition, the use of ammonia as a processing agent reduces certain controversial smoke
constituents identified by the Surgeon General

 

None of today’s testimony changes the fact that the use of reconstituted sheet is a technique t0
reduce "tar" and nicotine in cigarettes. We could stop using those techniques, But the consequence
of doing that would be a return to the 1940's, when the average cigarette yielded 40 milligrams of
"tar" and 2.8 milligrams of nicotine -- more than three times what the average is today. According
lo the 1989 Surgeon General's Report, sinee 1957 "tar" and nicotine have been reduced by 60%.

 

 

 

Al this information has been available to the government and the American people for fully 50
‘years and in published government documents 20 years ago.

   

If Mr. Waxman and Dr. Kessler’s goal is to eliminate adult Americans’ ability to choose to smoke,
they should, as our chairman, James W. Johnston, said in April, simply ban the product rather than
trying to slip through the back doors of prohibition.
