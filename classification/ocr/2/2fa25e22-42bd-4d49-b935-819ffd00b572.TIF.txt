ale Tag Corporati

 

!'ve spoken with Jack, and our thinking is to propose to John Michael Harlow that the Bale Tag Corporation consider
establishing a secondary category of membership (forthe sake of discussion, a Contributing Member), who would
‘ot sit on the Board or any committee and would not be involvad in making policy for the BTC, but would contribute
financially and would have access to the data. Lipson has called Harlow, who is out until Tuesday, but will speak
‘with him then and then call me. Fl catch up with you next week when youre back in once | speak with Jack.
