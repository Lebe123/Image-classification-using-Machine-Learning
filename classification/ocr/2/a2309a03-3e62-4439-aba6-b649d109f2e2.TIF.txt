Many thanks for the info. Yes, I hope to be in Pittsburgh
for the FTA. I

know Mike was working with the AWMA to get us some sort of
presence there.

Best,
Mario

P.S. I hope you'll be glued to your TV set tomorrow: Italy
plays the

Netherlands in the semi-finals of the European Cup. France
and Portugal are

in the other. Of course I'm pulling for Italy, but the
Dutch are very

strong, They beat Yugoslavia 6-1 on the weekend.
