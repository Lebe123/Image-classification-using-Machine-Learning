Subject: FRE! 1699 Legal Conferenco
Colleen,

‘Thank you forthe invitation to the legal conference. 1 send my conference registration to the email address once | have
my fights arranged.

|Lam interested in the breakout session, ‘Legal Technology’. We have set up a simple file support system for Tom and
Jonathan and their secretaries that uses Excel and Word macros to keep a fe lst and prints labels. ‘We have also set up
‘electronic fle folders on the shared departmental drives that mirror as much as possible their paper fling system. The
idea being that electronic ‘fies’ should be filed in the same way as paper ‘fles”. Currently this system tracks about 2,000
ile folders for Tom and Jonathan. We are also using this fle support system with two groups in the Operations
Department in Malaysia and the Philippines. The fle support system forthe Legal Department has been in place for more
than 1 year and it seems to be working, The one in Malaysia has been in place for about 10 months and it seems to be
‘working. | installed and trained the staff in the Philippines a few weeks ago.

We also have asimfar ype ot fle support system using MS Access instead of Excel and Word fr departments that nave
rrore members and fle. We use ths one in Records Management and pant instal it for Qually Systems Department hn
Malaysia ths fall

 

Do you think it would be appropriate to briefly explain how this kind of file support system works at this breakout session?
|was thinking! coud do a handout and afew sds and if people were interested | could send tem the emp fies by
‘email from Hong Kong, Anyway, if you don't think so, don't worry, | won't be upset!

Thanks,

Bill Proudfit
Manager, Records Management
