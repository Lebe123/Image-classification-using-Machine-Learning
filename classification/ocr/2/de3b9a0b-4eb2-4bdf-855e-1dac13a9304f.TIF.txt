Subject: Doral Pricing Strategy
Date: June 14, 1995

This documents a revision we need to make asap to the decision rules for determining
‘whether Doral is on/off strategy. In response to increased GPC promotion activity,
Doral’s ceiling has becn increased to $3.00 in 9 regions, effective June 1. Attached is a
copy of the memo from Cliff to Andy detailing the change. I’ve summarized it for our
purposes below.

© In9 regions, increase the Doral ceiling to $0.30/$3.00 in all outlets. These regions are
MWSA, Northern and Southern California, and Seattle.

 

‘© For all remaining regions, keep the ceiling as is. That is $0.20/$2.00 in all outlets
except CO's, where the ceiling is $0.30/83.00.

© Make this effective in the data for next Saturday's update. J understand it is not
possible to rerun the back data to make this effective for the first two weeks in June in
the trended reports currently under development.

The timing on this revision appears to be open. Please keep these revised ceiling levels

for Doral in place in the affected regions until further notice. It is possible and even
likely that other regions may be added to this list in the future.
