Guy,

Good idea. If Winston is willing to do this within their planned WC Series
advertising spending budget (as you suggest, I think it makes alot of sense. |
don't believe, however, we should spend additional monies on WC Series
advertising so that we can accomodate VIBE. If Winston is not willing to make
that concession, don't we also have some advertising plans that call for us to
advertise on youth smoking issues. If there is pub spending planned for that, then
perhaps there could be some tradeoffs made to accomodate the VIBE space.

Will you talk with Douglas and Ned on this WC series advertising suggestion of
Guy's and get their thoughts.

Do we have a plan to advertise youth smoking issues in pubs for 2000? If so, how
much is planned and is VIBE included already in the plan?

Let me know

Ken

about how we can achieve our goal but not pull anything from Vibe. Maybe this is
possible, maybe itis not. We have an obligation to run advertising for Nascar.
Nascar has a problem about not involving african-americans. African americans
read vibe. How about running our nascar advertising in the space we have
bought from vibe. At least one prominent african american (Len elmore) has said
to me that he thinks that what needs to be done is not have a black driver or black
ownership, but rather simply promote the sp0ort to blacks. so, how about us
doing it in this way. Maybe we don't have ads specifically directed to african-
americans. So what. we have to spend the money to run the advertising and we
