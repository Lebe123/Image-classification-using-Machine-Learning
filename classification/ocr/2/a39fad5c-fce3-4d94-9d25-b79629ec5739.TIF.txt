am advance. | apologize forthe length ofthis note and the amount of deta. the intention isto equally
inform all parties concemned about the status and next steps of several programs that we want 1 inte
charlotte,

this note takes precedence over any pre
discussed below

 

communication you may have received on the topics

‘we have three near term objectives in charlowe:
1. confirm our intuition about various clements in the chat plan that are being modified in the
expansion plan
2. test the effectiveness of certain elements we are planning to use in ovr expansion plan, and
3. build a base of “seed” smokers in the market a the same time.

1 want wo inform you of six specific (but related) tests we want to conduct in charlotte which will accomplish
all three of the above objectives
streamline launch mailer est (1000 stnokers)
benefit mle test (1000 smokers)
rodifed launch mailer test (1000 smokers)
rermailer test (a part ofthe test 1-3)
rela take one test (benefit mailer)
“monly” mailer test

 

the first five are closely elated exccutionally in that they are all designed to reeruit smokers into sneak
Dreviews. additionally, we have flushed out most, if not all of the details associated with these tests. the dm
Only tests still in a conceptual stage but I include it so you know it will be coming down the pipe soon,

for tests 1-5 we are expecting approx. 450 - 600 calls to the ROOF. we are expecting approx. 300 smokers
toattend P's,

attached is detsiled program design forthe first 5 tests and a timeline that hopefully, “brings it all
together". 1 will provide a materials and cost summary under separate cover. pls let me know if you have
‘any questions about any of i. i've tried to outline brand accountabilities within the program design sheets,
