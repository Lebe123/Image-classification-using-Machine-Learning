Winston-Salem, N.C. -- As a part of a restructuring of the worldwide tobacco business
of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., it was announced today that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co, will
‘be climinating approximately 500 jobs in its Winston-Salem operations.

"Any changes requiring the climination of jobs are difficult," said Andrew J. Schindler,
president and chief executive officer of Reynolds Tobacco. “But this step is necessary to ensure
that we are focusing resources where they will have a marketplace impact in our highly
competitive industry. ‘To that end, we will be redeploying resources to further strengthen our

marketing and sales programs so that we can better serve our retail customers and strengthen

 

‘our position in the marketplace

"To the extent possible, we will attempt to match employees who express a desire to
retire with jobs that are being climinated,” Schindler said. "Employees whose jobs are
eliminated will be offered the same severance and benefits package we have offered in the

past
