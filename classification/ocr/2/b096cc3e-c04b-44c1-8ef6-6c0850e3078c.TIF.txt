Tom, I'm hoping that the issue of the reliability of SAP FA2 is more perceived that real. Ann Jerome
and Larry Cortes identified and fixed many problems this past Fall. Most were associated with the
1997 dala load you referenced. | just heard today that there may be some information that didn't
make it to SAP when we did the data load. At this point, I'm not sure what we can do if itis truly lost.
We may have to re-evaluate those items.

Other than that, | think you captured how we got to where we are.

have received several requests this week to help resolve some issues with the MES database that may impede the
implomentation of the “red zone” for Contamination Control if not resolved rapidly. After talking to a number of folks, |
want to summarize my understanding of the issues.

Issues

4. The data in the MES database is not correct or complete or easily retrieved(or all three).

- Known items previously approved cannot always be found.

<The time required to do searches is too long.

+ Audit findings are supporting the above observations.

2. The data in MES that was “dumped! from the old R&D database to SAP F2 is especially suspect.
= Cannot discam site specific approvals due to missing info.
= 80% of the data came from this dump; only the most recent data is reliable,

3, The program used to dump the data in 1997 has been lost.
= Cannot re-construct the logic used to transfer data.
* Cannot easily re-do the dump.

4, The original data set(prior to the dump) was lost.
“understand that both Ann and Larry have copies of the data

9222892902

6. MES Coordinators at all ofthe sites are having difficulty doing retrievals or may be mis-interpreting the data.
Training is needed to be sure that consistent decisions are made.
= Support is needed to make searches easier.
