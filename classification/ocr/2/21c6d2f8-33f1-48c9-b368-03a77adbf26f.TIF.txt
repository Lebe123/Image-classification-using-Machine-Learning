patti, i think that The Web is more appropriate for Camel
vs. Kamel.

although it certainly is cool, i believe it's more camel
cool than kamel

cool, i.e., the camel person is on the internet but the
kame] person is

probably designing his/her own websites. i think the web is
more of a

how-to/entertainment type guide, that will have universal
appeal among

people surfing the net. in many respects it reminds me of
an entertainment

weekly for the web.

if you have any questions,
