Establishment Script

Culley, Liz

Here's a summary of what I believe has happened with the Establishment and Ambassador
scripts at CRI.

 

1) The scripts I faxed to you are what we believed to be the currently loaded scripts at CRI
for both Establishment and Ambassador

2) In discussions with Heather and test calls, I learned thatthe script being used by CSRs on
the Establishment and Ambassador lines is exactly the same (and not like what I faxed to
you). As you heard when you completed atest call, the CSR is prompted to ask if you are
affliated with a Philip Morris Co. or not. Dependent on your answer, the call is either
‘uoated as an Ambassador or Establishment call from that point forward.

3) Neither Peter nor Heather are aware as to why this change was made in the scripting
from what was provided to CRI. ‘These changes took place before Heather's time and
Kowal’s assuming some responsibility for the Estblishment program. Peter believes that
Katrina and Gerry King at CRI worked directly together in implementing these scripts. From
ACSR usage standpoint, the current flow is easier than having separate scripts for the
different line, Perhaps a decision was made to combine these two scripts to make it easier for
CSRs to work with? To be honest, I'm not sure anyone at PM checked to see if what was
provided for scripts was what was actually loaded. [ know no one at Kowal did because that
‘was not part of our responsibilities a the time.

4) CSRs should not be asking if you are 21 years of age or older. It does not appear on the
screen in front of the CSR. We made that change earlier this year and it has been
incorporated by CRI. One CSR told me she asked the question because she felt it was
missing from the sereen. She understood that you were always supposed to ask an
Accommodation caller if they were 21 years of age or older. It appears that a number of
CSRs operate under this myth.

  

 

asked Peter some of the same questions you asked me. He was very surprised that the calls
flowed that way and he remembers only providing separate scripts for each individual line
and assumed that they were being programmed that way.

- Why didn't Kowal/anyone catch this in quality control? Peter told me that at the time these
seripis were writen, it was not in Kowals responsibilities to do this type of work on the
Estblishment program. He noted that we did submit a proposal to do similar QA work on the
Establishment program, as we were doing on the Consumer program atthe time, but this was
not approved and our involvement stayed primarily with the Consumer program.

~ Why didn't we catch this in test calls earlier this year? Aside from the Bill Clinton theory of
selective recall (and "don't ask/don' tell” and, I saw Tm a Democrat but act like a
Republican), I have to take some blame here. In doing test calls, which I began in March, 1
‘guess I assumed that the scripting the CSR was using was what was approved and in the
system prior to my time. Thad no exposure to the script prior to this time and [evaluated the
calls more from a service level (which wasn't that good) and focused more on how they were
