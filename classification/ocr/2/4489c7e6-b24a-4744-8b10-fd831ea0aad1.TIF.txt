DENNIS AND RICK,

| HAVE REQUESTED THAT LHC BEGIN THE ARTWORK ON THE 2000 MISS WINSTON AUTOGRAPH
CARDS. MR. ANDREW HALVERSON WILL BE CONTACTING YOU REGARDING THIS PROJECT. WHAT HE WILL.
NEED TO KNOW IS THEIR NAMES AND ARRANGE FOR ANY ADDITIONAL PICTURES WE MIGHT REQUIRE TO
MAKE THE 2000 VERSION. THE COPY WE PLACE ON THE BACK OF THE CARDS IS USUALLY SUPPLIED BY SME
‘SO | REQUESTING YOUR HELP IN UPDATING THE INFORMATION AS NEEDED.

‘ON A SEPARATE NOTE, IT IS MY OPINION THAT THE DRAG MISS WINSTON OUTFIT IS SUPERIOR IN
DESIGN TO THOSE THAT WE ARE USING IN CUP. CLIFF POINTED OUT THAT HE BELIEVES THAT JACKIE'S DID
NOT REGISTER WINSTON THAT WELL AND DEB BRITTSON AND | WILL BE ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE WITH THIS
‘YEAR'S DESIGN.

WHAT | WOULD LIKE CUP OPERATIONS TO CONSIDER IS THAT BRAND IS WILLING TO GET A DESIGNER
INVOLVED TO SPRUCE UP OUR WINSTON CUP MISS WINSTON ATTIRE. | TRULY BELIEVE THAT IT [SOUT OF
DATE, LOOKS LIKE A MALE SHOULD WEAR IT, AND IS NOT ACHIEVING A MODERN IMAGE FOR WINSTON AT
‘AND AWAY FROM THE EVENT.

| WELCOME YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS ISSUE AS | WOULD LIKE TO PROCEED WITH A REDESIGN ASAP.
‘TO MAKE THE PREVIEW OR AT WORST THE BUD SHOOT OUT IN FEB. 2000.

‘THANKS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION,

(MIKE FAGAN
