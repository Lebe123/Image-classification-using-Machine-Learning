‘The next Labour Government will seek to improve the health ofthe nation's poorest
families by banning tobacco advertising, Opposition health spokesman Baroness Jay of

Paddington pledged tonight

Lady Jay, opening a Lords debate on poverty and ill health, told peers: “itis
<isgracetul that the Government has not taken tougher action to curb smoking. An
incoming Labour Government will ban tobacco advertising as a priority in our public
health policy."

‘There would also be a new Minister of Public Health "to lead public health policy at the
national level and to coordinate local action as well as to encourage good practice".

Labour would also “review and re-publish” the Government's 1982 Health of the Nation’
stratogy in 1998, to coincide withthe 50th anniversary of the start ofthe National Health
Service.

‘The new version was likely to follow the Australian strategy, which called for action in
five areas: distribution of economic resources, education, lving standards, conditions of
‘work, and social support

“This approach would reflect our determination to make improved health a central goal
ofall social policy,” Lady Jay declared,

“We wil aim to reduce poverty and inequality through a commitment to help people
move trom welfare to work: to end poverty pay by introducing a national minimum wage
‘and to improve housing conditions by the phased release of local authority capital
receipts.”

Lady Jey went on:"The embition is o ensue that these meesures inavicualy produce
improvements in the health of our poorest families and that together they create more
equity and a more inclusive socioty.

“To achieve an inclusive society where everyone, not just the advantaged and affluent,
has the opportunity to achieve their greatest health would indeed be a victory for socal
justice,

Lady Jay's pledge on tobacco advertising was later attacked by the president of the
Motor Sport industry Association, Tory Lord Astor of Hever, who warned that it would
have a “devastating effect" on an industry which was a “real Bish success story”

Lady Jay, daughter of former Labour Prime Minister Lord Callaghan of Cardi, had
cealior spoken of a “stark health divide" between the richest and poorest sections of
society.

The average life expectancy of the richest 10% was eight years longer than forthe
‘poorest 10%, and the poorest were more than twice as likely to de early.

Halt of Britain's children, some four millon, were being brought up in poverty, often in
single-parent househoids.

Lady Jay, a heaith authority vice-chairman, stressed: “thas litle to do with the
performance of the NHS.”

tt was more to do with unemployment, bad housing, lack of nutrtious food, and
insecurity.

“All the evidence shows that when poor familias get poorer, their first economy is
food," she said. But perhaps the Government’ “single greatest falure™ was is failure to
tackle the tobacco industry.

“Today smoking is predominantly a habit of the poor. And conventional health
‘education will have vary lite impact on disadvantaged people who may see cigarettes as
‘an important prop in dificut ives."

Lady Jay protested: ‘This is an absolutely intolerable situation. We cannot passively
sit and observe as the greet gains in heath and welfare which most of us have enjoyed
