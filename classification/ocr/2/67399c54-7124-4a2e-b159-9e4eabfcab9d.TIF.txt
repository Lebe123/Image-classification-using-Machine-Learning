Hi Mare,

''m really sory to bother you about this, but | need to get back to Denise Keane re: what | was
able to collect in the way of completed, checked translations for the EU languages. If can lighten
the burden on you by contacting the relevant players directly to request copies of the translations
‘andor status updates, | would be happy to do so: just let me know whom | need to speak with for
‘each language.

Thanks very much,

Jamie
