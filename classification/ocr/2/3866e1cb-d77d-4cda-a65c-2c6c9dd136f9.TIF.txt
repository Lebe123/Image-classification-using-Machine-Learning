Karen-
See note below rom Greg, We need to dscuss before | get back to him and know tat fomorow sgh buts bere
‘anyway we can do it then'??7?

‘Taree topline thougts on my end:
41) Budget breakdown! thought it would be more along the lines of $50-S65M but wel need him to just.

2) Would lke to discuss the whole RFP process as | have some concerns about SGMA sending out an RFP yet the
$85 is primarly awarded from PM YSP--maybe our best bet is to give them the funds to award and they handle it
‘s0up to nuls go-to-speak. However, there are Issues if i's done that way as well

3) The timaline seems quite long--1 thought Greg was troubleshooting his BOD and from the sound oft there is sti,
‘work that needs to be done —uhich is actually ok, but Im not sure why he has specified 3 weeks meeting w/ the BOD
(4/1-4/20) vs. a single presentation to the BOD.

 

Let me know if you think we can squoeze ths in tomorrow or if our discussion needs to take place on Monday, I can
have MM schedule.
