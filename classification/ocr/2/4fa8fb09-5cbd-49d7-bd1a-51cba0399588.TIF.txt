Denise-
know it’s been years since we've last spoke, however, the recent events in

NY and DC have made me think about the many peopie that | know and have lost,
contact with, | hope this email finds you and that everything is oay with

‘your family. Much has happened since our time at Tufts- I went on and got

‘my masters and law degree- and now I'm lving in Indianapolis (not my ideal

place to live) and working for the NCAA. I'm not married I'm stil

looking for my prince charming) and my 2 cats and puppy are considered my

kids (pathetic, | know).

Well, | won't ramble except to say thet | hope to make it to NY this fall
and if do, | hope you don't mind if | give you a call.

Take Care-
Jan
