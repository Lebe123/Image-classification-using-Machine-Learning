Subject: 7 Pleasures DSD Kit

Mike:

Thave 11:30 to noon appt. scheduled with you today. I need a time critical, urgent
response to an item we are looking to put in the DSD (direct store delivery) Kit to support
the 7 Pleasures of the Casbah in non-restricted states. The item we are looking at, outside
of the traditional POS (point of sale) pieces, is a match caddy. This would be an easel
card with a holder/box that contains matches that would promote the 7 Pleasures
campaign and 800 #.

‘Can we have matches available at retail in the non-restricted states. Please reference
Winston's Ad Match program. Also, I believe Salem has utilized matches in the past.

‘Thanks, John & Fran are looking to get a ruling on this asap.
