‘Two final items. You can send me your decks electronically by mid-
day Tuesday and we will take care of getting them burned on a CD
rom for you. In addition, would you like to do a group rehearsal on
Sunday in FLA? Remember, we only have one hour and your
presentations can be bo longer than 15 minutes. It is your call--let me
know.
