Junior Booth & Bookiets

 

Hania, Please keep me posted on the status of the YSP booklets je. the date they go to production, when they are
expected to be shipped, etc. have a few events lining up in Nov. and | cannot commit booklets since | don't know if they/l
be ready.

‘Also, please close the loop on the Junior booth update. | know Alan Kloor at CES is prepared to send us the invoice for the
job so | assume it is complete. Did someone from Landor go down, how does it look, were there any problems, and most
importantly, is t ready to be shipped out for events?

  

‘You can call or email, whichever is easier. Thanks Hania,
