New Text Item: RECORDS

George, I would prefer not to send this out to the Field.
Most of the issues on here do not pertain to them. Brenda
Russell is the Records Coordinator for the Field and she
will send then a letter explaining any changes after we
Feceive the new policies and procedures. If you want to
discuss, give me a call on extension 7224. Thanks.
