Rockland, Mass. -- Earlier in December, the board of health unanimously voted to table a
proposed retail regulation until 1/14, The proposal would ban self-service displays and
vending machines and increase licensing fees. Bob Stone requests mail and phone calls to
the retailers to urge their attendance at this meeting.

Mesa, Ariz, - The city council voted on 12/20 to amend the city’s smoking ban. The
ordinance allows smoking in bars and restaurant bar areas. Restaurants can get a hardship
variance if they can prove a.15 percent loss over a four month period. Businesses can also
have a separate outdoor smoking arca and hotels can allow smoking in private, rented
‘conference rooms. Opponents of the smoking ban filed sufficient signature to force either
modification of the ban or a special election on the issue. Although 5 of the 7 council
‘members said they supported a special election, the council decided to amend rather than
call for an election. The city clerk said that an election was still possible, but not likely.
The amended language will go into effect 30 days from passage.
