employer's Ligoility with a limiz o* $1,000,000; comprehensive genera: Liabilizy with
eSabil-ty limits of at leas: £5,000,900; and corgrehensive automobile Liability for atl
Vehicles with limits of no -oss' tha: $5,000,000. These requirements are no: viable for
the contracts T am worsing Gn for swo reasons. Consultants wko actualy operaze a
