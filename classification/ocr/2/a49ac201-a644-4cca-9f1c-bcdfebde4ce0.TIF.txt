ACTUALLY, AM MORE CONCERNED WITH THE ISSUE OF ALCOHOL AND FEEL THAT IS
(OVERPLAYED ON TV. A REGULAR PACK OF CIGARETTES MAY NOT CAUSE A CAR
CRASH

‘OR DUIS FOR PEOPLE, BUT THE BEER AND WHISKEY DOES, IF SOMEONE SMOKES.
WEED THEN IT CANB HAVE AN EFEECT ON SENSES, BUT | FEEL STOREBOUGHT
CIGARETTES ARE TO BE USED WITHIN OBVIOUS LIMLITS, LIKE NOT BY BABY OR
