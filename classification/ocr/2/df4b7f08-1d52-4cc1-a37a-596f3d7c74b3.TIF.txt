We have just finalized the dates for our final upgrade to Gifts 4.0 due to some fixes we needed MicroEdge to do.
We are now scheduled to upgrade on Nov 1 - Nov 3 at which time I would like to have the software installed on
your machines.

In addition, | would ike to schedule your training for November 7 with Michelle Barbeau. Please let me know if
these dates are okay with you and also provide us with alist of users and their locations.

Finally - we are developing a intranet site for Gifts and are seeking quotes. The following is what Carolyn Levy

thoughts??? Can we get Carolyn's permission???
