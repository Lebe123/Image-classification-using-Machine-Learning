Subject: RR status meeting

 

‘Amy, looked through your notes, and have some questions. I'm disappointed that you are still listing
YP and Parliament together, While some of the issues might affect both departments, T can't respond
because the details are lumped together.

‘Also, I haven't taken any action on this yet. Can you tell me when T will have to inform Carolyn and Y&R
about these issues? Thanks.
