In response to the questions relayed to us by our Sales Department, I'd like to give you
more information about Camel's new “Pleasure to Burn” advertising campaign.

‘The “Pleasure to Burn” campaign is a well-rounded campaign that accurately depicts “the
old and new” by mixing contemporary and classic with alittle bit of fun. It celebrates the
heritage of the Camel brand yet is relevant to today. It's also an excellent display for
retail given its vibrant colors and simple visuals.

‘The “Pleasure to Bum” ads capitalize on the fact that Camel holds a unique position as a
cigarette brand which has a rich heritage but also keeps up with the times. The campaign
celebrates the decades of Camel's popularity -- reflecting different cultural periods and
tastes in our society — but also brings the ads up to date by juxtaposing elements of past
eras and contemporary cues. At first glimpse, the ads appear to have a retro feel, but a
second look reveals utterly modern elements. For example, a male detective wears a
classic hat and trench coat, but sports an earring; and a lady reminiscent of past eras chats
on a cell phone.

The ads are designed to stand out and deliver a telegraphic and impactful message. It
offers us a highly branded format, but in a classic painting style that feels more like art
than advertising. The format is designed to translate easily and impactfully to many
different media and applications — a variety of sizes, shapes, formats and locations. For
example, the graphics would work in a magazine ad, a bar sign, a direct-mail piece, or in
retail display.

It is important to us in developing advertising that we not only clearly communicate the
brand's message in a distinctive way, but we emphasize being sensitive to how
consumers might perceive the ad. All of our advertising concepts are presented to an in-
house “advertising review panel” to get reactions from average employees who work in
various departments outside our sales and marketing areas, and tested with consumer
focus groups. Consumer testing showed that the “Pleasure to Burn” ads had very broad
appeal among adult smokers of all ages and both genders. In focus groups among male
and female adult smokers ranging in age from 21 to fifties, the “Pleasure to Burn” ads got
an overwhelmingly positive response from both males and females. They described the
ads as “fun,” “upbeat”, nostalgic yet contemporary ~ the elements that capture Camel's
personality and image.

  

An article in the New York Times (September 22) described the “Pleasure to Burn” ads
as “a playful commemoration of the Camel brand’s history.”

Enclosed are samples of some ads from the “Pleasure to Burn” campaign.
