Re: Grant No. 2207R2
Dear Mr. Gertenbach,
oops!

Please pardon my oversight in not returning these requested
materials in a timely manner, I remember that I sent a pack of
reprints to the Counci] last fall, and I guess I thought that I had
sent everything.

Donâ€™t think that my oversight indicates that this grant has not
been important tome, It has enabled me to carry out projects that
otherwise would not have gotten done. I believe that those have
been important projects, and they are just now coming to full
fruition. I hope you have considered the funds well invested.

111 try to write you a bang-up (and timely) final report at the
conclusion of this year.

Yours sincerely,
jlo C fille
