Please find enclosed a letter from Tim Finnegan dated
February 26, 1977, together with enclosures.

We propose support for a one-year pilot study of genetic
and environmental factors that may be involved in lung cancer by
Dr. Henry Rothschild, Professor of Medicine and Anatomy at
Louisiana State Medical Center. The enclosed budget calls for

$17,900.
I have discussed this with Dr. William Gardner and

recommend funding Dr. Rothschild's study as a CTR special
project.

Sincerely,

William W. Shinn
