Dear Preston,

Following my talk today with Mr. Lougas, here is a copy of U.K. Patent *
granted to Pailip Norris in connection with C0, process.

My people here are aware of the Airco Patent granted in Cormany. We
understand a similar Patent Application has been filed in the U.K., bat must
asune that it will be cancelled out ty the enclosed Patent, which ie moh
more specific.

I understand you picked up an Airco Patent in Australia, ave you seen
similer Patents to the Philip Morrie or Aiveo in the U.S?

â€˜Yours, sincerely,

{AL
