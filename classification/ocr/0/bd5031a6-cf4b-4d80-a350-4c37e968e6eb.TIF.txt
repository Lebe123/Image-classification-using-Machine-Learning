Dear Tim,

In reply to your question regarding Red Man Tobacco having an ad in your
Dover Downs program, we have decided that itis ok for Red Man to purchase
advertising space in your program but they will not be allowed to sample or
promote their products in any other method on Dover Downsâ€™ property.

Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at
(336) 741-6493.

Regards,
R. Dennis Dawson
Manager
