RE: Application 55061/80

Beta-hydroxyalkyl Heterocyclic Flavorants

 

Dear Mr, Macauley:

Please respond as you indicated in this application. The enclosed
issued U.S. Patent 4,259,969 lists art cited in its prosecution, and it will be
seen that no significant amendment of claims was required. Two claims were
separated on a requirement for restriction and are transferred to a pending
divisional application.

Very truly yours,
