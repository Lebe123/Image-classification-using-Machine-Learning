Dear Dr. Serota:

This letter accompanies the shipment of two (2) test articles:
B170 and B212. These test articles are to be submitted for the
28-Day Subchronic Oral Toxicity Study in Rats.

The following listed values are to be used as the dose levels
for these studies:

B170 5000 mg/kg
2500 mg/kg
500 mg/kg

B212 3000 mg/kg
1500 mg/kg
300 mg/kg

Please take extra care when handling these materials. Both B170
and B212 are scarce and obtaining extra material would be very
difficult.

Material B170 should be dosed in distilled water; information on
the vehicle to be used for material B212 will be forwarded at a
later date.â€˜

Compound Physical Parameters Listings are enclosed for each of
the articles submitted. We request that all articles be stored
under refrigeration until used.

Sincerely,

ow 9, Dune
