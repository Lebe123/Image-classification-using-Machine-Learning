Dear Congresswoman Smith:

As a taxpayer and daytime bartender, | think it is important for you
to understand how | feel about the smoking ban. | want to work here
because | am a smoker. My customers come here because they like to
smoke while they have their drinks, There are many more non-
smoking places they can go to if they donâ€™t want to be around smoke.

This is very simple logic. And until you make the sale of cigarettes

illegal, then leave us alone. | thought you were elected to get big
brother off of our backs

Sincerely,

\Gare Nelle
