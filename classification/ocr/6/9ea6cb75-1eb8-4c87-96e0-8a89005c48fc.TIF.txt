The coll number as well as the hexokinase and glucokinase activity
of liver parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells were studied in metha~
Pyrilene treated rats. The ntmber of nonparenchymal cells was doubled
after treatment with methapyrilenc for two weeks while that of hepa=
tocytes remained constant. The hexokinase activity was increased
fourfold in the nonparenchymal cell fraction while it was unchanged
in the parenchymal cells. The glucokinase activity was decreased in
the hepatocytes to one third. Hence, the increased hexokinase acti-
vity was due to a proliferation of nonparenchymal cells rather than
to a toxic dedifferentiation of hepatocytes. =

 

The antihistaminic drug methapyrilene was used therapeutically
until its carcinogenic potency was recognized a few years ago. After
long-term administration to rats hepatocelluler carcinomas develop
(1). However, long before preneoplastic foci occur, toxic alterations
are observed mainly in the periportal zone of the liver acinus (2).
These morphological changes are accompanied by an inversion of the
metabolic zonation, which is indicated by an increase in hexokinase
(Bc 2.7.1.1) in the periportal zone and decrease of glucokinase

(Bc 2.7.1.2) in the perivenous zone of the liver acinus (2). How
ever, no conclusive information is available, whether the increase
of hexokinase is due to parenchymal (PC) or to nonparenchymal cells
(eC). Therefore, in the present study, the hexokinase and the gluco-
kinase activities were determined in parenchymal and nonparenchymal
cells separated tro livers of methapyrilene treated animals. the
hexokinase was increased fourfold in the nonparenchymal cell fraction
by enhancement of the nonparenchymal cell number as well as by an
Ancrease of the collular level of the enzyme. On the other hand the
hexokinase activity present in parenchymal cells was not changed
throughout the experiment, while the glucokinase activity was sig-
nificantly reduced.
