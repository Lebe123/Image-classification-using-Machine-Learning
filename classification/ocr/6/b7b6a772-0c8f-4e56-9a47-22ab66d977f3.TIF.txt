Introduction

After its fist use inthe Chicago stock-
yards in 1908, chlorination of drinking water
spread rapidly throughout the United States
and produced dramatic reductions in mor-
bidity and morality associated with water-
bbome diseas.! Since then, chlorine has re-
‘mained the method of choice for water
purification; itis currently added to approx:
‘mately 5% ofthe nation’s drinking water?
In 1974, Rook? discovered that the combi
nation of chlorine with organic compounds.
in drinking water produced halogenated or-
‘ganic compounds—chioroform, in paricu-
Tar. In 1975, the National Organics Recon-
naissance Survey verified that chlorination
by-products were a major contaminant of
chlorinated surface water. The study also
showed that chloroform concentration cor-
relates highly with the concentrations of
‘other halogenated hydrocarbons and is,
therefore, a useful indicator forthe presence
‘of these compounds. Since this finding, a
plethora of epidemiological studies* have
investigated possible associations between
‘consumption of chlorinated water and can-
‘er. These studies conser a wide range of
populations and regions and demonstrate
somewhat inconsistent pattems of associa-
tion. We used metacanalytic methods to
pool the results of these studies in an at-
tempt to funher our understanding of the
relationship berween water chlorination and
neoplastic diseases. Meta-analysis provides
greater statistical power and greater resolu-
‘ion inthe estimation of relative risks than
so individual studies.

Methods

Identifcation of Relevant Studies

To identify references pertaining to
the relationship between chlorination of

drinking water and neoplastic diseases,
‘we used the Medline data retrieval system
to search the medical, public health, and
biological literature from 1966 through
1991. Relevant papers were obtained and
reviewed to locate additional references.

‘Because intial analyses suggested an as-
sociation between chlorination and both
bladder and rectal cancer, the Medline
system was used to conduct a second
search of the literature over the same 25-
year period for papers that considered
these neoplasms and mentioned water in
the tile, abstract, or keywords.

Only those studies that identified
morbidity or mortality as well as exposure
land potential confounders at the level of
the individual (,e., case-control or cohort
studies) were included in the meta-analy
sis, Studies that considered incidence and
‘exposure at the level ofa region or com
‘munity (Le., ecological studies) were ex:
cluded.
