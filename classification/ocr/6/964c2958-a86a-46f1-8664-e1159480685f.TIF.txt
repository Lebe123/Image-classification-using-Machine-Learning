Abstract Circadian and utadian shyms of plasm cotsol concentrations have been documen
under physiological conditions in diverse animal species. Using novel, biophysical convolution model
to remove subject-specific metabolic clearance rates, we have now estimated spontaneous ae
secreory events in vive. The later were characterized by prominent ultadian rhythms of dis
screory bursts with prides averaging 32, 46,76, and 130 mia. These ulzadian cortisol see.
shyt represented a 17- to 240-fld larger faction of circadian seretory variations than dd contol
‘concenttionshythms. We conclude that deconvolution analysis can unmask underlying ulead
stythms in adrenal secretory activity én vivo.

Physiological cicadian and ultradian rhythms in plasma cortisol concentrations have been
recognized in a variety of animal species under various conditions of health and disease
(Perkoff et al., 1959; Onh etal, 1967; Hellman et al., 1970; Weitzman ct al., 1971; Srivastva
and Meier, 1972; Walter-Van Cauter et al., 1981; Ottenveller et al., 1986; Krieger ahd
Aschoff, 1989). Such rhythms in the circulating concentrations of glucocorticoid hormone
are associated with major adaptive responses of organisms to environmental cues, sre
and other externally originating and intemally derived stimuli (Krieger and Aschoff, 198
‘Variations in blood cortisol concentrations overtime are assumed to confer varying degrees
‘of agonist exposure to the target cell. However, such temporal oscillations in plasma glu-
<cocorticoid concentrations do not directly reveal the physiological nature of adrenal glandular
secretory activity, since plasma hormone concentrations result from the combined operation
of secretory events and endogenous subject-specific metabolic clearance rates (Veldhuis| et
al., 1987; Urbanet al, 1988). Accordingly, despite the vast experimental literature describ

is relatively litle knowledge of the nyetohemeral and ultradian features of adrenal cortical
secretory events per se. Such information is of interest, since regulation of endocrine glandular
secretory rhythms can be anticipated in various settings.
