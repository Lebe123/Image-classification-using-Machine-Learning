 

Stress, defined here as a challenge to the organism, has long

been implicated as a cause of coronary disezse. Major progress

in controlling this disease will be by prevention, which in this case

and aggravation of an enormously wide
‘range of human ills, including coronary heart
disease. Litde controlled scientific research
‘has been done in this area, and understanding

‘concept of stress. This paper attempts some
larification of the concepe and suggests pos-

trolling coronary heart disease,
