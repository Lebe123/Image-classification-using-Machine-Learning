Intcoduction

eLapachone (3.tlitydea-2,2-dimethy-2H-naphthol1.2-b] pyran
'6edione) is a naturally occurring product that can be easily obtained
fom lapachol, an abundant quinone present in the lapacho tree (Tae:
‘buia avellanedae) native 0 South America (1-3). We demonstrated
previously that f-lapachone did not alter the activities of eukaryotic

Boothtan er a. (7) that f-lapachone actually inhibited Topo I by &
‘very ifferent mechanism than other currently used Topo I inbibitors
Like camptothecia, the compound inhibited the unwinding activity of
‘Topo I but did not result in stabilization of DNA-Topo I complexes
under standard SDS-K* assay techniques (7). To our knowledge,
Belapactone is the only known compound that binds directly to Topo
and inhibits its enzymatic activity (7, 8). Thus, the apparent activa
tion of Topo I observed eatlier (4) probably resulted from a nicking
reaction without sabiization of DNA-Topo I complexes (7). Toese
data with -lapachone indicated to us that Topo T was involved in
[DNA repair and may be exploited after radiation therapy in tumors
‘with elevated levels ofthis enzyme, including melanomas, lung car-
tinomas, breast cancers, and colon and prostate cancers (6,9, 10).

‘ince Topo I inhibitors ae known to cause apoptotic reactions (11,
12), we explored f-lapachone-mediated apoptosis in various human,
cells. We demonsirate that treatment of human promyelocytic leuke-
toia (HL-60) or human prostate (DU-14S, PC, and LNCaP) cancer
cells with B-lapachone specifically resulted in blockage of cell evele
fprogession at Gy'G, and induced apoptosis. In contrast, treatment of
human breast cancer cells with equitoxie concentrations of f-lapa~
chone did not result in visible induction of apoptosis in 24,
