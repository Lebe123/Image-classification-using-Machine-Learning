Introduction
Mutations in the p59 gene are the single most common ge
netic alteration observed with human cancers (1, 2). Com=
only, one p53 allele contains 2 missense mutation pro-

‘faulty protein, whereas the second allele is lost by

 

8 reduction to homozygosity (3). Ths ebservation, plus the

cancers in a 2-6emonth time period, demonstrates that the
p53 gene is indeed a tumor suppressor gene (4). During
tumorigenesis, selective pressures on tumor suppressor
genes result in mutant alleles that have a lass of function
‘These mutant alleles are recessive tothe wildiy
ate characterized by the absence ofa particular phenotype.
The p53 mutant alleles from human cancers, however, ap-
pear to have been selected (86% of the time) to comain
Inissense mutations that produce altered or faulty proteins
that accumulate tohigh levels in the cancer celle. tndeed,
92% of 1447 p53 mutations sequenced from h
‘cerous tissue are localized in aretrcted region
{between codons 120 and 290, of 393 codons), suggesting
selection for an altered p53 protein product with specific
phenotypic properties (6). The few mutations observed Oute
Side of tis region ofthe p53 gene tfor example, 12 mutants
observed at codon 298 or 341) are all chain ermination
‘mutations. This suggests tha tumorigenesis selects not only
ageinst expression of wild-type p53 but also for expression

“The p53 missense mutations from murine and human

readily detected by monoclonal antibodies that react with
the wild.type (12) oF mutant protein (13); (f) mutant p53
proteins have lost or show a reduced ability to function as

Fesponsive efement (14-17); and (g) the inoduction of mu-
tant 52 alleles into cell with no endogenous p53 proteins

‘that spontaneous tumorigenesis in humans not only selects
for a loss ofa p33 function (tumor suppressor function), but
the gain of additional properties or phenotypes mediated by
a faulty protein encoded by alleles mutated at a subset of
specific codons.
