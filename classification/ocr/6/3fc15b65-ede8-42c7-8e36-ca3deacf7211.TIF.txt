What happens when cigarette smokers give up the habit? Do their chances
of dying of pulmonary and cardiac diseases decrease? Do they lose
various physical complaints? Evidence on these points is presented

in this report, and the evidence indicates that those who stop have a

more favorable future, and the longer they stop the better

the outlook.

EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTS OF GIVING UP

CIGARETTE SMOKING

E.Cuyler Hammond, SeD,, FAPIHA.

EDENcE on the eles of ving wp
smoking is more dificult to obtain
than one might suppose. We must first
inquire why some habitual smokers give
up the habit and whether, once having
stopped smoking, they are likely to re:
sume the habit at a later date.

In a mail survey conducted in 1958,
wwe asked excigarette smokers why they
hhad stopped and whether they thought

ving up the habit had any effect
on their health or the way they felt
‘About 60 per cent said that they had
stopped because of some physical com-
plaint such as cough, chest or throat
complaints, loss of appetite, stomach
trouble, or circulatory difficulties. Eighty-
two per cent of those who ssid that they
had stopped because of a physical com:
plaint indicated some improvement
(such as less coughing) as an apparent
result of giving up the habit. Seventy:
four per cent of the men said that they
gained weight.

Table 1 shows the reasons for giving
up smoking as stated by a sample of
men between the ages of 50 and 69
who filled out questionnaires in late
1959 and early 1960. All of these men

had a history of only cigarette smoking
and had stopped less than a year prior
to answering the questionnaire. About
17 per cent of them were “sick at pres:
* Over half of those who were sick
that they quit smoking because of
some illness oF physical complaint and
over three-quarters of those who were
not “sick at present” gave the same
sort of reasons. The most frequently
stated reasons were “doctor's orders,”
heart and circulatory diseases, and pul
monary complaints such as cough, fu,
sinus trouble, and other respiratory con-
ditions.

‘Two years after enrollment in a pro-
spective epidemiological study, surviving
subjects were requested to fill out a
second questionnaire? They were asked
whether they had been hospitalized and
whether they had any serious diseases
Since enrolling in the study. They were
‘also asked how many cigarettes they
currently smoked per day.

‘The data shown in Table 2 are con-
fined to male subjects between the ages
‘of 50 and 69 who were smoking ciga
rettes regularly when enrolled in the
study. Tt shows the per cent who were
