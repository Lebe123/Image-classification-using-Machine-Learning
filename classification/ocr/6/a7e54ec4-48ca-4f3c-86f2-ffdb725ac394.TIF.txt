Previous studies have demonstrated that acute elevations in
the intracellular second messenger cAMP can induce and/or
regulate conductive chloride pathways and thereby alter the
‘membrane potential (P-D.) [1-3] in various epithelia such as
kidney (1, 4, S}, trachea (6, 7), gallbladder (3, 8], and shark
rectal gland (2]. This messenger has also been reported to
‘modulate ionic chloride permeability in some non-polarized
cells, the normal human red blood cell [9] and the cultured
lymphocyte [10]. While these observations were made during
pharmacologic manipulations that acutely elevated intracellular
‘CAMP concentrations, similar changes have also been detected,
in membranes of cells in which cAMP is endogenously and
chronically increased: relative ionic chloride permeability of

RBC ghosts and RBC cAMP concentrations are both increased
in untreated uremic humans; after treatment with peritoneal
dialysis both are indistinguishable from those in normal vol
teers [9]. Based on the fact that renal failure is aecompanied by
clevated plasma concentrations of several hormones that act
vate adenylate cyclase (PTH, norepinephrine, glucagon, and
ADH) [1-13], it was postulated that an increase in relative
ionic chloride permeability might not be confined to the red cell,
but rather might represent a more global change in membrane
permeability in chronic renal failure. Since intracellular chio-
Fide activity is at or above electrochemical equilibrium in
diverse issues [1, 7, 8, 14, 1S], a selective increase in rel
ionic chloride permeability would depolarize cells (1, 3, 5]. If
such were the case, the resultant perturbations in cell function
(thats, transport and electrical signaling) could be responsible,
at least in part, for a number of systemic manifestations of renal
failure.

‘The present studies were designed to determine whether an
increase in membrane ionic chloride permeability is confined 10
human red cell membranes or whether such an increase occurs.
in other cells in renal fulure, The 75% nephrectomized rat was.
used as a model of renal failure. These studies demonstrate that
renal failure in the rat is accompanied by increases in renal
cortical cAMP concentration and relative ionic chloride perme
ability of renal cortical brush border membranes. Of note, these
changes were not confined to renal cortical membranes. As io,
the human {9}, red blood cell cAMP concentrations and the
‘onic chioride permeability of RBC membranes were signfi-
cantly increased in renal failure in the rat. The demonstration of
qualitatively similar findings in membranes of both potarized
and non-polarized cells suggests that membrane ionic perme-
ability may be significantly altered in a number of tissues in
renal failure in association with hormonally induced increases
in intracellular concentrations of cAMP.

 

 

 
  

 

Methods

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into sham operated,
luninephrectomized and 75% nephrectomized groups. All ani-
‘mals were anesthetized by an intraperitoncal injection of pen-
tobarbital 45 mpke body wt (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis,
Missouri, USA). Thereafter, kidneys were exposed by blunt
dissection via bilateral fank incisions. The eight kidney was
excised in uninephrectomized and 75% nephrectomized ani-
‘mals: 759 nephrectomy was produced by further ligation of the
