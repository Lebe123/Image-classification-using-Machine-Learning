Highly charged polyanionic ligands of the scavenger
receptor trigger macrophage secretion of urokinase-
type plasminogen activator (uPA). In experiments re-
Ported here, we have investigated the intracellular and
extracellular regulation of polyanion-induced macro-
phage plasminogen activation. Exposure of a macro-
phage cell line (RAW264.7) to either fucoidan ot phor-
‘bol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulates the secretion of
UPA, whereas calcium ionophore or dibutyryl eyelic
AMP had no effect. Moreover, preincubation of mac-
rophages with inhibitors of protein kinase C reduced
(60-60%) the ability of both fucoidan and PMA to
trigger the secretion of uPA, whereas aspirin and ei
eosatetraenoic acid had no effect. Both PMA and fu.
‘coidan treatment of RAW 264.7 ceils resulted ina rapid
‘and transient increase in the steady state levels of uPA,
mRNA. However, in marked contrast to that observed
with PMA, fucoidan-induced expression of RAW264.7,
UPA activity was partially insensitive to cycloheximide
and actinomycin D. In addition, fucoidan-induced uPA
activity was detected in conditioned media in as little

6 15 min, whereas PMA-induced uPA activity did not
increase until 2 h. [n addition to stimulating macro:
phage seeretion of uPA, fucoidan bound uPA and had.
small stimulatory affect on uPA activity, The binding,
does not interfere with the catalytie site on the B chain,
or require the receptor binding or kringle domains on
the A chain.

nor fucoidan were able to stizvulate the release of uPA activity
from U937 cells, a monocyte-like cell line devoid of scavenger
receptor activity (25)."These findings suggest that endocytosis
of a diverse group of polyxnions by the scavenger receptor
may play a role in the regulation of macrophage-dependent
plasminogen activation,

In experiments reported here, we have sought to define the
regulatory mechanisms involved in polyanion-induced uPA
expression by macrophages, First, we have identified the
rajor cell signaling patiscay operational in polvanion-in-
duced expression of macrophage uPA activity. Second, we
hhave determined the effee: of inhibitors of protein and RNA
synthesis on polyanion-induced uPA activity, as well as qua
