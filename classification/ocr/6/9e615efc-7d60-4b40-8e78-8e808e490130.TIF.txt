1. Introduction

‘The importance of zine and copper in biochemical and physiological processes
21 ll levels of cellular complexity is now: vell established and their roles in
bocteria. fungi plants. anim, and nian have been studied intensively (or
review, see Maynard, 1979; O°Dell, 1976: Prasad, 1979 thus been shown that
Zine plays significant roe in DNA. RNA, protein, and lipid syntheses (Rio.
an, 1976; Cunnane and Horrobin, 1980), and zinc and copper are intimately
involved a cofactors in a number of important enzyme systems, nonenzymatic
proteins (O°Dell. 1976: Riordan and Valle, 1976), and other molecules. The
concentrations of the two elements in different ses can be measured quan-
titavely by various analytical procedures (Mikac-Devie, 1970). However, the
amounts ofthese race elements donot permit their reise localization a cellular
and subcellular levels. In this review our sim i to give an account of the
available histochemical procedures for the cellule localization of zine and cop:
pet. allowing deeper insight into their role in physiological and biochemical
processes.
