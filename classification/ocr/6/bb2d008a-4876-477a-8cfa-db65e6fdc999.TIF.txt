Of particalar interest are the occa
sions when a nonsmoker fs in a con-
fined space. Examples of this sita-
sation would be an sutomobile, =
plane, a bos, or a meeting room. Cal-
culations bave been made on the build-
‘up of CO in confined spaces with ent
ployment. of empirical equations.'*
Several equations bave also been
derived for the uptake of CO a
‘arboxybemogiobin (COHD)*™ This
stady examines existing mathemati-

 

‘eal expressions and derives a single
‘expreecion that wouid permit the cal-
‘calation of OOH change in non-
‘smoker when in a confined space.
