‘The gene ofthe human cytomegalovirus (HCMY) major envelope glycoprotein, gB, was cloned
from the Towne strain and inserted into adenovirus type $ downstream ofthe E3 promote. The
recombinant virus, Ad-gB, expressed antigenically related proteins of $8, 30, 25, and 23 kDa
fn AS49 and MRC-S cells; the S8-kDa protein had the same mobility asthe native gB from HCMY-
infected MRC-S cells and virions. All four proteins were detected by a monospecific polyclonal
antiserum and by a monoclonal antibody in immunoblot and immunofluorescence assays, Ham-
sters infected intranasally with ive Ad-gB developed protein-specfic and HCMV-neutralizing
antibody. This study confirms the importance of gB in the generation ofthe neutralizing immune
response to HCMV and demonstrates the potential of live adenoviruses as vaccine vectors

   

 

 

Although the efficacy ofan experimental lve attenuated
(Towne strain) human eytomegelovirus (HCMY) vaccine has
been demonstrated (i, concerns about live herpesvirus vac-
ination have prompted efforts o identify HCMY virion pro-
tein subunits that are devoid of nucleic acid but retain the
immunogenic capacity of lve whole virus. One such subunit
is the major envelope glycoprotein, a disulfide-linked com-
plex with components of 130-116 and 58-$5 kDa, This com-
plex is commonly refered to as "gB" based on tmino acid
homology witha herpes simplex vius envelope glycoprotein
[2]. IF CMY gBis functionally analogous tits herpes sim-

plex virus counterpart, it may be critical to virus infectivity
‘and may elicit protective immunity when administered as a
vaccine {3}, In fact, immunoaffinity-purifed gB [4] and gB
expressed by vaccinia virus recombinants (2, 5} induce neu-
tralizing antibody in experimental animals. Tn addition, we
recently demonstrated that intramuscular administration of
purified gB to human volunteers elicits de novo lymphocyte
proliferation and neutralizing antibody [6]. The potential of
¢gB as a subunit vaccine is further supported by amino acid
sequence data that suggest « high degree of conservation
among HCMV strains [7]

Adenoviruses have been identified as promising live recom-
binant vaccine vectors based on their ability to induce high
levels of heterologous gene expression in mammalian cells
(reviewed in 8}). These well-studied viruses represent anal
ternative to vaccinia virus, which may not find widespread
use in humans due to historical evidence of adverse sequelae,
Adenoviruses may possess distinct advantages, such as the
‘potential for oral administration and the induction of mucosal
immunity, Live, enterically administered adenovirus vaccines
have been used in the US military since 1969; despite ~10
rillion subjects vaccinated, no side effects have been reported
[9]. The immunogenicity of adenovirus recombinants express-
