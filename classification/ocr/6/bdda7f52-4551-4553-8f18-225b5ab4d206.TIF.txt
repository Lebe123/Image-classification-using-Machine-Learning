‘Traditional epidemiologic research relied on self-reported
‘measures of “extemal exposure” in defining the association be-
tween cigarette smoking and cancer risk. With elucidation of
carcinogen-induced geneuic and epigenetic events, knowledge of,
the molecular etiology of smoking-related cancers has expanded
rapidly and has facilitated the study of tobacco carcinogenesis.

"The dose of tobacco carcinogens to which lung tissue is ex-
posed is modulated by genetic polymorphisms in the enzymes
responsible for activation (phase 1) and detoxification (phase fl)
of tobacco carcinogens. For example, the cytochrome(s) P50
multigene superfamily of enzymes is involved in phase I oxida-
tive processes that may create intermediates that are more reac-
tive than the parent compounds and can be carcinogenic or mu~
tagenic. Phase TI metabolic processes generally inactivate these
genotoxic compounds through conjugation that promotes cellu-
lar excretion. The activated intermediates covalently bind 10
[DNA and form carcinogen-macromolecular adducts. Indispens-

‘us effect of mutagens. by excising the adduct and repairing the

repair capacity that have been shown to influence susceptibility,
to carcinogenesis, At the poor end of the repair spectrum are
‘patients with xeroderma piginentosum who have defects in ex-
cision repair of UV photoproducts and extreme sensitivity (0
sunlight-induced skin carcinogenesis.

Lung cancer risk may thus be defined by a variety of factors,
including the balance between metabolic activation and detox
fication of tobacco carcinogen compounds, as well as by the
efficiency of DNA repair, The net effect of these processes isthe
‘carcinogen-DNA adduct. Adducts then should bea valuable and
relevant marker of biologically effective exposure over time. As

carcinogen exposure and metabolism, DNA repair capacity. and

‘The report by Wiencke et al. (1) provides interesting and
thought-provoking data, suggesting an inverse association be-
‘tween age at smoking initiation and aromatic DNA adduct levels,
in the lung tissue of former smokers. In contrast. such a rel
tionship was not evident in current smokers in whom smoking.
intensity was the variable best associated with adduct level
‘These differences were attributed to masking of the age effect in
current smokers by their approximately twofold higher adduct
levels. The data in former smokers are in contrast with the pro-

file that fits that of the genetically susceptible individual. who
‘could be expected to develop cancer at earlier ages andéor with
fewer pack-years of exposure than nonsusceptibe individuals. in
fact, Ryberg tal. (2) found an inverse correlation between years

‘The methods for measuring smoking-related aromatic DNA
adducts are those used by many other laboratories; however. 00
thin-layer chromatographic autoradiograms are shown 1o enable
‘comparison of the chromatograms. This is particularly important
because its not clear whether the same adducts are being mea-
sured in current versus former smokers. Schoket et al. (3) esi
mated the apparent half-life for bulky DNA adduets in the bron-
chial tissue to be {.7 years in former smokers. In the study by
‘Wiencke etal. (1), the former smokers had stopped smoking for
fan average of 11.9 years. Genetic alterations ffom tobacco car-
cinogen exposure may persist in former smokers. even in the
presence of histologically normal appearing epithelium (4.51
‘Thus, an area for more research is further elucidation of the
kinetics of adduct removal.

‘The potential mechanisms associated with the observation
that DNA adduct levels are higher in those patients who started
smoking earlier are logical and based on knowledge of the fate
of carcinogen-DNA adducts studied in human cells and tissues
and in animal model systems (6,7) If DNA adduct accumulation
is the mechanism for the observed age at smoking initiation
effect, then it would be very important to know in which cels of,
the tissue the DNA adducts have accumulated, One might not
‘expect DNA adducts to accumulate in surrogate populations of
cells to the same extent as in lung tissue.

‘The authors show an excellent correlation between smoking-
related aromatic DNA adducts in target (lung) tissue and blood
‘mononuclear cells. These results are consistent with the authors"
earlier work and suggest that such cells may serve as a useful
surrogate forthe lung target tissue. This i an important finding.
although the use of blood monocytes as a surrogate remains
controversial.

It can be hypothesized that DNA repair capacity and level of
cytogenetic damage in the lymphocytes reflect processes occur-
fing in the target organ. This hypothesis needs to be further
evaluated if we are to develop quantitative risk assessment mod-
cls for lung cancer. The conduct of large-scale population stud-
Jes requires us to utilize readily accessible noninvasive tissues.
‘Analysis of the DNA adduct levels in blood mononuclear cells.

of the process. For example, does the relationship between age
