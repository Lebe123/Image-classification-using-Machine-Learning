Schizosaccharomyces pombe: A Model for Molecular Studies of
Eukaryotic Genes

YUQI ZHAO! and HOWARD B. LIEBERMAN

ABSTRACT

Several features of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe make it exceptionally well suited for the
study of eukaryotic genes. Its a relatively simple eukaryote that can be readily grown and manipulat
the laboratory, using a variety of highly developed and sophisticated methodologies. Schizosaccharomyces
pombe cells share many molecular, genetic, and biochemical features with cells from multicellular
organisms, making ita particularly useful model to study the structure, function, and regulation of genes
from more complex species. For examples, this yeast divides by binary fission, has many genes that contain
introns, is eapable of using mammalian gene promoters and potyadenylation signals, and has been used to
‘clone mammalian genes by functional complementation of mutants. We present a summary of the biology
of S. pombe, useful features that make it amenable to laboratory studies, and molecular techniques
available to manipulate the genome of this organism as well as other eukaryotic genes within the fission

 

 

‘yeast cellular environment.

INTRODUCTION

[UMEROUS FEATURES OF THE FISSION YEAST Schizosac-

‘charomces pombe make it an attractive model system
for molecular genetic studies of eukaryotic genes. This
small, relatively simple eukaryote possesses many of the
same fundamental cellular properties of larger, multicellular
‘organisms. However, itcan be manipulated inthe laboratory
readily and has 2 relatively short doubling time, making it
amenable to many types of experiments, Furthermore, 5.
pombe has a relatively small genome size, approximately
1.5 10” bp in the haploid state, which is about three times
larger than that of Escherichia colt. Another useful feature of
S. pombe is that it usually exists as 2 haploid organism. This
characteristic facilitates the creation and identification of
‘mutants. In addition, cells can be mated to construct strains
with desired genetic backgrounds and to study genes in
haploid as well as diploid cells. Haploids, diploids, and

    

fetrads can be purified and used for subsequent genetic
analysis

‘The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been
studied extensively. Therefore, wat makes S, pombe, at the
Jeast, another attractive model system for studying eukary-
otic genes? Even though S. cerevisiae and S. pombe are both
ascomycetes, they are not very closely related evolution-
atily. Protein sequence comparisons have indicated that S.
pombe is nearly as distant from S. cerevisiae as it i from
mammals (Russell, 1989), At the gene level, mammalian
introns can be spliced properly in fission yeast (Kaufer etal,
1985), and introns within S. pombe genes are also appropri-
ately spliced when acomponent ofthe yeast spliceosome, U2
snRNA, is replaced by a human equivalent (Shuster and
Guthrie, 1990). In addition, mammalian promoter and
poly(A) signals are functional in S. pombe but not i
cerevisiae (Russel, 1989). The conservation of gene activity
between S. pombe and mammals was clearly demonstrated
