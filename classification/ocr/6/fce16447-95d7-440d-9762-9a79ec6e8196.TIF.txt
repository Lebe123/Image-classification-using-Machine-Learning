Introduction

Several attempts have been made to estimate U.S. adult
mortality from passive smoking. For example. Repace
and Lowrey (1985) estimated the lung cancer deaths to
be about $000 per year. Fong (1982) estimated total
mortality at 10,000 to 50,000. Russell e al. (1986) es-
timated total U.S. mortality at more than 4000. The
present estimate is based on epidemiological evidence
currently available on lung cancer, cancers other than
lung. and heart disease.

The Surgeon General of the United States (USSG.
1986) and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences
(NRC. 1986) have issued reports stating that passive
smoking can cause lung cancer. In the National Acad-
emy report the relative risks from the various lung can-
cer studies were combined into an overall relative risk
using a procedure somewhat similar to that which is
used in this work. The Academy report then projects
that about 20% of the 12,000 U.S. lung cancer deaths
per year among never smokers is due to passive smok-
ing. This is reasonably close to the 3000 per year pro-
jected here for never smokers plus exsmokers. The
methods used in the National Academy report are fur-
ther detailed in Wald er al. (1986). Blot and Fraumeni
(1986) have also presented an overview of studies of
lung cancer and passive smoking. They use a method

of combining the relative risks from various studies es-
sentially identical to that used here. Thus. the proce-
dure of combining relative risks from various passive
smoking studies to obtain overall relative risks and
tighter confidence intervals is now well established by
authorities in the field. Also. the method used here to
calculate annual deaths from the relative risks appears
to be validated by the National Academy results for
lung cancer. However. both the Surgeon General's task
force and that of the National Academy felt that the
data, as of 1986, on cancers other than lung and on
heart disease were still too meager to allow calculation
of reliable overall risks.

Since 1985 considerably new epidemiological infor-
mation has become available. particularly on heart dis-
ease. This new information is reviewed and combined
with the old data to calculate updated relative risks.
Overall confidence limits, and estimated annual U.S.
deaths from passive smoking and the three main dis-
eases, namely, lung cancer. cancers other than lung.
and ischemic heart disease. The total particulate matter
dose retained by passive smokers is too low to account
for the health effects of passive smoking if one starts
with the health effects exhibited by direct smokers and
ratios down from the dose retained by them. Reasons
why such a discrepancy might occur are explored.
