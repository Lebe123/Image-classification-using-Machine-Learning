Assteact Using cultured cells from bovine and rat aortas, we have examined the possibility
that endothelial cells might regulate the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells. Conditioned
medium from confluent bovine aortic endothelial cells inhibited the proliferation of growth-
arrested smooth muscle cells. Conditioned medium from exponentiat endothelial cells, and
from exponential or confluent smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts, did not inhibit smooth
muscle cell growth. Conditioned medium from confluent endothelial cells did not inhibit the
growth of endothelial cells or fibroblasts. In addition to the apparent speciticity of both the
producer and target cell, the inhibitory activity was heat stable and not atfected by proteases.
1 was sensitive to Flavabacterium heparinase but not to hyaluronidase or chondroitin sulfate
ABC lyase. It thus appears to be a heparinlike substance. Two other lines of evidence support
this conclusion. First, a crude isolate of glycosaminoglycans (1CA-soluble, ethanol-precipitable
material) from endothelial cell-conditioned medium reconstituted in 20% serum inhibited
smooth muscle cell growth; glycosaminoglycans isolated feom unconditioned medium (ie,
0.4% serum) had no effect on smooth muscle cell growth. No inhibition was seen if the
glycosaminoglycan preparation was treated with heparinase. Second, exogenous hepatin,
heparan sultate, chondroitin sulfate B (detmatan sulfate), chondroitin sulfate ABC, and hyalu-
ronic acid were added to 20% serum and tested for their ability to inhibit smooth muscle cell
growth. Heparin inhibited growth at concentrations as low as 10 ng/ml, Other glycosamino-
Blycany had no effect at doses up to 10 ug/ml. Anticoagulant and non-anticoagulant heparin
were equally effective at inhibiting smooth muscle cell growth, as they were in vivo following
endothelial injury (Clowes and Karnovsk. Nature (Lond.). 265:625-626, 1977; Guyton etal. Circ
Res. 46:625-634, 1980), and in vitro following exposure of smooth muscle cells to platelet
extract (Hoover et al. Circ, Res. 47:578-583, 1980). We suggest that vascular endothelial cells
may secrete a heparinlike substance in vivo which may regulate the growth of underlying
smooth muscle cells

 

  

 

 

 

A characteristic feature of the normal, healthy arterial wal is
that the intimal endothelial cells fare a continuous quiescent
‘monolayer. and the underlying medial smooth musele cells
alo remain im a quiescent growih state. I the endothelium 1s
damaged. smooth muscle cell proliferation accuts until the
«endothelium regenerates (9,29), The regulation of cell growth
in the vascular wall ts poorly understood. Ross (1S. 28) and
‘thers (10, 25) have shown that platelet-derived growth factors
are tequired for smooth muscle cell growth in vive and in vith.
Recenily. conditioned medium fiom macrophages has been
found to stimulate smooth muscle cells (23). Gajdusek et a

a2

(11) have shown that endothelial cells produce a factor which
stimulates the grossth of smooth muscle cel. Eisenstein et al
(8) have found that extracts from the inner arterial wall can be
fractionated 10 produce both stimulators and inhibitors of
smooth muscle cll gros,

‘We present evidence demonstrating that cultured endothelial
cells produce both postive and negative effecirs of smooth
‘muscle cell growth. The inhibitory activity appeats to be hep-
ain or @ heparialike molecule. These results suggest a possible
role for heparin in the regulation of vascular smooth muscle
cell growth in vivo,
