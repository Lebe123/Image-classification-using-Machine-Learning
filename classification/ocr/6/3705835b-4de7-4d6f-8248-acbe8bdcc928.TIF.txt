 

The Effects of Smoking Policy

on Indoor Air Quality '
and Sick Building Syndrome

in 18 Air-Conditioned Offices

A. Hedge WA, Erickson

ABSTRACT

A study ofthe effets of smoking policy on indoor air qual-
‘iy and sick building syndrome symptoms among 3,155 workers
in I8 private sector air-conditioned office buildings is described.
Five smoking policies were investigated: smoking prohibited,
“smoking restricted to rooms with local filtration, smoking res-
tricted to rooms with no local air treatment, smoking restricted
{0 rooms with separate ventilation, and smoking restricted to
the open-plan cubicle workstations and enclosed offices. Levels
of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, respirable particulates,
formaldehyde, ultraviolet particulate mass, nicotine, air tem
perature, and relative humidity were measured at eight sample
sites in each building. Approximately 30 workers at each of the
eight somple sites completed an exiensive questionnaire on
‘environmental conditions, sick building syndrome symptoms,
{0b satisfaction, job stress, smoking history, and personal
‘details. Indoor air quality measures met the current ASHRAE
{92-1989 standard. Comparison of al open-office sites between
policies showed no significant differences in levels of carbon
‘monoxide, carbon dixide, formaldehyde, or respirable particu-
lates. Levels of ultraviolet particulate mass and relative humid
ity were significantly lower in buildings where smoking is
prohibited, and ar temperature was significantly higher in these
buildings, although on average this was <I°C. Among al bulld-
‘ngs, air temperature was the only physical measure hat was sig-
nificantly correlated with SBS symptoms. Smoking policy had
ro significant effet on sick buildin syndrome symptoms.

INTRODUCTION

‘Tobacco smoking indoors has been identified asa source of
‘a number of indoor air contaminants, especially particulate
‘matter (Hodgson 1989; Van DeWiel etal. 1989) and combustion
‘products (Godish 1990). Burning tobacco releases several thou-
‘sand pollutants into theair, of which about 400 have been quan-
tified (US, Surgeon General 1986). Environmental tobacco
smoke (ETS) is an aerosol comprising vapor and particulate
phases, both of which contain many organic and inorganic com
pounds (Eatough etal. 1988). ETS is a combination of side-
stream smoke ($8) from the burning cigarette and exhaled

‘mainstream smoke (MS) from the smoker (Guerin et al. 1987;
Reasor 1987). The exposure of nonsmokers to second-hand
stoke is termed “passive smoking!” Passive smoking has been
linked toa variety of health problems, including ung cancer and
‘cardiovascular disease (OTA 1986; Samet eta. 1987).

‘Throughout the past decade, concerns have grown about
the association between indoor air quality AQ) in the work:
place and a variety of health complaint, including symptoms of
the “sick building” syndrome. The sick building syndrome
(SBS) describes a collection of nonspecific symptoms, including
eye, nose, and throat irritation, mental fatigue, headaches,
nausea, dizziness, and skin irritation, which seem to be linked
with occupancy of certain workplaces (WHO 1983; Burge etal.
1987), SBS symptoms are experienced at work but are alleviated
‘when away from work for any period of time. SBS complaints
among office workers are thought to be caused by poor IAQ, but
substantial empirical evidence suggests that SBS problems arise
from the combined effects of a variety of environmental and
nonenvironmental risk factors (Hedge 1989; Hedge et al. 1989).

‘Tentative evidence of an association between passive smok-
ing and SBS complaints in U.K. offices has been reported
(Robertson et al. 1987), but this has not been systematically
investigated. Indeed, SBS complaints are more frequent among
smokers (Hodgson and Collopy 1989). In recent years, many
‘companies have introduced a smoking-probibited policy, but
since up to 30% of workers may be smokers, implementing such
1 policy may not be the most cost-effective alternative. To
balance the requirements of nonsmokers and smokers, other
‘companies have implemented spatially restrictive smoking poi-
cies, which confine smoking to certain areas of the building.
Such polices attempt to minimize any widespread ai pollution
{rom cigarette smoking through dilution ventilation, localized
filtration, or separate ventilation.

‘This paper summarizes findings from an ongoing research
project investigating the effects of diferent smoking polices on
IAQ and SBS complaints in air-conditioned private sector
office buildings. Results for 18 office buildings using five dffer-
‘ent smoking polices ae described.
