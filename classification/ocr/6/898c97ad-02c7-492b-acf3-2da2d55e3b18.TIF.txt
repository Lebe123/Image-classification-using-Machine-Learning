'TRODUCTION

Historically, the relationship of dietary fuctors and can-
cer has been established from epidemiological studies fol-
lowed by studies of basic cancer biology, Investigations
concerning the potential involvement of niacin as a pre-
ventive factor in carcinogenesis ae evolving in the reverse
direction, Results from biochemical and cellular studies
concerning the role of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD), the active form ofthe vitamin niacin, asa substrate
in adenosine diphosphoribose (ADP-ribose) transfer reac-
tions have stimulated an investigation of the relationship
between niacin and cancer that is now being addressed by
‘molecular epidemiology [1]. The development and prelim
inary results of these studies are described here.

A rapid biochemical response to carcinogen-indueed
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage is the synthesis of
ADP-ribose polymers from NAD (2]. This metabolism has

that cells that have not been subjected to injury have very
ow ADP-ribose polymer content, Agents that lead to DNA
strand breaks cause « 1apicl increase in polymer content
Increases of as muci as (000 fold in afew minutes are not
uncommon. Indeed pols-ier synthesis can exceed the max-
imal rate of NAD biosvnthesis by at least a factor of 10,
which can result in cpletion of the cellular NAD pool,
Am interesting feature ot iis metabolism is that polymers
made in response to DNA strand breaks are present very
‘transiently [4]. Individul polymer residue half-lives range
from a few seconds to x low mimutes. Methods to allow
characterization of the size distribution and location of |
endogenous polymers ‘subfractions of chromatin have
been developed in our laboratory and have led to a pro-
posed model in which ADP-ribose polymer metabolism
effects recovery from 1 damage by niediation of the
association of a damayed region of chromatin with the
