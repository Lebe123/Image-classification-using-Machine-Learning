igh molecular weight kininogen (HK), a single chain
plasma glycoprotein, serves asa cofactor inthe contact system of|
blood coagulation. After cleavage by human plasma kallikrein,
the nonapeptide bradykinin is released. The HK light chain (LC)
contains coagulant activity, which requires both the ability to bind
‘the contact system 2ymogens, prekallikrein and factor Xl, and the
ability toi tively charged surfaces. Since bacterial
expression m uccessful if carbohydrate was required
for activity, we evaluated that possibility by incubating plasma
HK with endoghyvosyase F Although the procedute removed
tecable N-linked carbohydrate, no change in specific activity
‘carted. We then developed a bacterial expression system (0
produce recombinant HK LC. The DNA coding for the HK LC
‘was prepared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), digested with
restriction enzymes EcoRI and Put, and introduced into the
‘bacterial expression vector pKK223-3. E.colt harboring this
recombinant plasmid (pSK1) expressed HK LC upon induction
with isopropytthiogaactoside (IPTG). The recombinant protein
27 kDa), when transferred onto a PVDF membrane, was recog:
nized by monospecific polyclonal anti-HK LC-antibodies. The
fecombinant HK LC was purified by heparin agarose atfinity
chromatography to homogeneity and found to have a specific
activity of 28 coagulant units per me protein, similar to the
specific activity of the LC derived by proteolytic digestion of
hhumian plasmia HK. We conclude: 1) The HK LC synthesized in
bacteria is biologically active, and 2) the 40% carbohydrate
content of the HIK LC is not require for its cofactor activity

 

   
      

 

    

 

 

 

 

Introductory Statement

Normal human plasma contains two different forms of kinino-
ens ~ low molecular weight kininogen (LK) and high molecular
weight kininogen (HK) derived from a single gene by differential
splicing (1). Toth kininogens are single chain glycoproteins
containing the identical amino terminal heavy chain, and bradyki
nin, but unigue earhoxyterminal light chains. ‘The plasma con-
ceniration of HK i 70-90 yt and of LK is 200-260 pesmi
(2-4). Both prekalikrein (PK) and factor XI (FX1) circulate in
plasma complexed to HK (5-7). In plasma, kallikrein cleaves
both HK and LK and releases bradykinin, a potent vasodilator,
The remsining portion of the kininogens are held together by a
Single disulfide bond between the heavy chain (M, 62,000) and the
light chain of LK (4, 4,000) or the light chain of HK (M, 56,000)
“The S6 kDa light chain of the HK (LC 1) is further cleaved to a
445 kDaalight chain (LC 2) by kallikrein. The heavy chain contains
‘qsteine protease inhibitory domains, while the LC of HK
coninins the anionic surface binding domain, the region binding
the 2ymogens, PK and FXI (8-10) and a heparin binding site. The
HK LC binds to surfaces and the attached PK is thereby

positioned for cleavage, which results in the exposure ofthe active
site of kallikrein (11), Following vascular damage, HK binds to
subendothelisl surfaces and renders. 2yinogens EXI and. PK
accessible to active factor XII (factor Xta) (12-14). Factor
Xila, generated by reciprocal activation of prckalikrein and
factor XU, initiates the itrinsc Blood coagulation pathway (15)
by converting FXI to factor Xta. Kallikrein triggers the inflam:
matory pathway by releasing bradykinin from HK. Patients with
kininogen deficieney of HK alone (Flaujac case (16) and Fitz
{gerald case (17)] oF of both FIK and LK (Williams case (18) show
defective blood clotting in vitro which ean be corrected by the
‘addition of purified HK. A monoclonal antibody, CIICI,
developed against the HK LC in our laboratory has been shown to
inhibit the coagulant activity ofthe HK (19) by blocking essential
residues required for the binding of HK to negatively charged
surfaces (20). However, attempis to characterize the domains for
anionic surface binding and to identify the mAb epitope have
been limited by the laborious purification and low yield of the
alkylated light chain of HK and the need to perform extensive
proteolytic modifications. Moreover, although HK contains 40%
‘ofits mass as eorbohydrate, the funtion ofthese side chins i
currently unknown. Hence, we adopted the recombinant DNA,
approach to produce light chain of HK to study steeture-function
relationships. In this present communication, we describe the
bacterial expression system for light chain of fiK, purification of
the recombinant protein, the biological activity of the purified
recombinant HK LC, and the role of carbohydrate in coagulant
activity
