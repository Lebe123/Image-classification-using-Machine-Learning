Patients with asthma often complain of respiratory symptoms during or after passive smoking
Experimental srdies on the effec of sbort-term passive smoking have been performed in adults but
notin children: their results are heterogeneous and’ some of them show deficiencies of their study
Gesign. In a series of controlled exposure studies we investigated the occurrence and degree of acute
cffests of shor-ierm passive smoking in adults and children with asthma. Taroughout allstudies we
‘used 2 constant cigarene smoke conceatration of 20:ppm carbon monoxide.

In dhe first study 24 adult patients witheild bronchial asthma and 16 healthy subjects were enrolled.
‘Subjecs breathed cigazene smoke or room air while siting at ret for one hour. Lang function was
measured before and after exposure, and: airway responsiveness to inhaled methacholine was
determined within one hour after exposure. As compared to room air, lung function parameters did
rot change significantly and airway responsiveness was pot altered after passive smoking,

[AS it seemed reasonable to expect a more pronounced airway response to air pollutants in children
than in adults, we then studied 11 ehiléren with mild bronchial asthma while using ap analogous
experimental protocol. However, similarly as seen in the adults, lung function and airway respoasive-
‘nets to inhaled histamine were not affecied by ope hot: of passive smoking in these children,

‘The next srudy was designed to investigate the effets of cigarette smoke during vs after exposure and
to compare the effects observed at renting ventilation with those observed at increased! ventilation
rate. Thirteen children with exercise-induced asthma participated in this study. Tey breathed either
Cigarene smoke or room air for one bour and exercised on a bicycle ergometer during the last six
minvies of exposure, Mean forced:expiratory volume in one second, as a measure of lung function,
decreased by about 5% during passive smoking as. compared to room air. This effect could be
lanribuied to tyes sooke-senstive children and disappeared during and after exercise testing,

Most patients with bronchial asthma sbow an inerease in symptoms, an impairment of lung functioa
and an enhancement of airway responsiveness during night compared to daytime. Tus, in 2 further
study we investigated the effects of passive smoking in the evening on the course of hung function
lind airway responsiveness until the next morning. Seventeen subjects with mild bronchial asthma
ere exposed to cigarene smoke or room air for Ure hours al rest, On the average, lung function
‘did not change duting passive smoking but demonstrated small impairments at 3.00-a.m. in the
right and 07.00 a.m. inthe next morning. Similarly, airway responsiveness to methacholine showed
2 tendency towards increased valves at these times.

From these studies we conclude that individual patients with asthma can sbow a temporary impair-
ment of long function during or several hours after passive smoking. It is noteworthy that itis,
Gifficat to detect smoke-sensitive subjects reliably, since there is no obvious correlation beween
measured changes of functional parameters and acute or anamnestic sympioms due 10 passive
smoking,
