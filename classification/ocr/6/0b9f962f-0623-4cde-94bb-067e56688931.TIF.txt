SUMMARY
“This paper outlines several meta-analytic approaches to the assessment of quantal dose-response
{elationships. that is, to the evaluation ofan increase inthe level of exposure to an agent and the associated
felative risk ofa disease when this is investigated over a numberof diferent studies. Analysis is developed at
two levels: first, @ consistent method of evaluating the dose-response relationship is applied to each study.
and seeond, an overall picture is obtained by comparing and combining these relationships. At the fist
‘tage for an individual study, dose-response assessment involves choices of model and appropriate tests for
trend, which are influenced by such issues as dose measurement and use of the unexposed group. At the
second stage different methods for pooling results across studies must be considered. These depend on the
choices made in the fist stage of analysis, with additional atention paid to heterogeneity, and possible bias
Sue to studies included in meta-analysis. We describe these meta-analytic approaches for three methods of,
‘evaluating dose response. The approaches ae illustrated by evaluating the relationship between lung cancer
“ind levels of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). The strength ofthis relationship has been
& point of debate in recent assessment of evidence for an overall carcinogenic efect of ETS exposure. We find
lite indication of @ consistent dose response, a result explained in terms of recent models for cancer and
passive smoking developed by Darby and Pike, the current meta-analysis results of overall risk-ratios of
Eureent studies in Tweedie and Mengersen, and misclasification models developed by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

1. INTRODUCTION

‘There are two reasons for assessing dose-response relationships, or the increase in level of risk of.
4 disease associated with an increase in level of exposure to a potentially harmful agent. First,
establishing such a relationship is one of several standard criteria for developing the case for the
agent in question actually being harmful; if increased risk occurs with increased dose, itis a strong
step in proving that a causal association exists. Second, when an association has been established
between an agent and a disease, the dose-response relationship is of crucial use in predicting the
levels of risk established for individuals at different levels of exposure

Both of these are unarguably important. Standard guidelines (see the International’Agency for
Research into Cancer (IARC) Report,’ or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
Guidelines?) for asserting that there is an established causal link between an agent and a disease
suggest establishing ofa significant dose-response effect as a valuable step. This isnot the only step
required to establish a causal relationship, and is probably of second-order importance compared
