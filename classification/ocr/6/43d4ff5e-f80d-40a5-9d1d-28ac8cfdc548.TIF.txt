Abstract: Immobilized oxidases were bound on the surface of an affinity
‘membrane and mounted on an oxygen clecrode. These biosensors were used
for heavy metal salt measurements After inmobilization of the eneymes, fist
order kinetics of inactivation were observed. Surface immobilization Increases
the senstvty by # factor of 10, compared to reticalation of the enzyme ia 2
selatin matrix.

‘After imumobilzation, $0% inactivation was observed with 20 uxt HCl for
Leglyeerophosphate oxidase and 50 aw for pyruvate oxidase, Restoration of
activity after HgCt, weatmentis feasible, bt neliber complete not reproducible.
To reuse the biosensor, Llactate dehydrogenase (LDH) trom rabbit muscle
in solution ‘was coupled to immobilized Linciae oxidase (insensitive, 10
heavy metal salts). LDH (particularly inexpensive) was replaced after each
measurement. The fy in phosphate buffer was 1 pw for HigCl, and Oe jt
for AgNOs: with other heavy metal salts, no inhibition was observed below
500 pat. In Tas butfer, the lg was 10 nx for CCl and ZnCl, 50 pa for
Ph-acetate and 250 pw for CuSO.

“The use of different enzymes and butfers may allow measurement of specie
beavy meta sas.
