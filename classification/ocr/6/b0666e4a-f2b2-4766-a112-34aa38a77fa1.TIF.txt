‘Murine 313T stem cells transfected with pSV3neo DNA were employed to study the effets of somatic cell
differentiation on simian virus 40 (SV40) T-antigen expression. This experimental approach was used because
‘the STIT cell line is a well-characterized in vitro adipocyte differentiation system and the pSV3neo plasmid
contains the early region of the SV40 genome and a selective marker, G18 resistance. Cell clones containing
stably integrated pSV neo which expressed T antigen were isolated in G418-containing medium, Most ofthese
cell clones differentiated poorly. However, several clones retained the abil
ipocytes, and with these cell clones, it was established that adipocyte differentiation markedly repressed.
‘T-antigen expression, The differentition-speciic repression of T-antigen expression did not result from a loss
of proliferative potential associated with terminal differentiation, because it was observed in adipocytes that
could be restimolated to proliferate. In such cells, restimulation of cell growth induced ceactivation of
‘T-antigen expression, Repression of T-antigen expression was also demonstrated during differentiation of SV40
‘T-antigen-immortalized human keratinocytes. These results establish that the process of cellular dilferentiation
‘can repress T-antigen expression In atleast {vo distinet biological systems.
