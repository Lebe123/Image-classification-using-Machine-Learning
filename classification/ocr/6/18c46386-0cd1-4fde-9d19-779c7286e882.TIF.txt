‘Thrombin stimulates phosphoinositide hydrolysis and increases cytosolic
types of cells. To determine whether thrombin exerts similar stimulatory a
and whether this mechanism is linked to changes in cardiac electrical activity, the effects of
thrombin on several biochemical and electrophysiological parameters were examined. In
neonatal rat ventricular myocyte cultures freed of fibroblast contamination by irradiation,
thrombin rapidly induced the breakdown of phosphoinositides. Formation of inositol trisphos-
phate was detectable within 5 seconds and was followed by the sequential accumulation of
inositol bisphosphate and inositol monophosphate. The effect of thrombin to stimulate
phosphoinositide hydrolysis was inhibited by hirudin, but not by propranolol, prazosin, or
pretreatment with pertussis toxin. The inositol phospholipid response was unassociated with
changes in intracellular cAMP levels. To determine the electrophysiological effects of thrombin,
‘we used microelectrode techniques to study canine Purkinje fibers. Thrombin increased the
beating rate of fibers depolarized using barium, but not those at normal maximal diastolic
potential, In addition, thrombin prolonged the action potential duration in fibers driven at a
constant cycle length, This response was inhibited by hirudin and nisoldipine, but not by
propranolol, prazosin, or pretreatment with pertussis toxin. Thrombin also augmented
cesium-induced early afterdepolarizations. Using the fluorescent calcium indicator fura-2, we
demonstrated that thrombin increased the beating rate, diastolic calcium, and peak systolic
calcium of spontaneously contracting cultured ventricular myocytes. Cytosolic calcium also
increased in both rat ventricular myocytes and canine Purkinje myocytes that were electrically
driven at a constant basic cycle length, indicating that thrombin modulates cellular calcium

trate several novel biological actions of thrombin in the mammalian heart that may
functionally related. The actions of thrombin to enhance automaticity and prolong revolute
tion may contribute to the clectrical abnormalities observed in the setting of myocardial
ischemia and infarction, (Circulation Research 1991;68:1216-1229)

tiates DNA synthesis and cell proliferation? Al-
though the precise intracellular signaling system un-
derlying the mitogenic response to thrombin is,
unknown, one of the earliest events detected in
thrombin-stimulated fibroblasts is the activation of a
phospholipase C that hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol
45-bisphosphate to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP,)
and diacylelycerol.** These two products act as in-
tracellular second messengers. IP, mobilizes calcium
from intracellular, nonmitochondrial stores and ele-
vates intracellular calcium ion concentration,
‘whereas diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C,
Which in turn stimulates Na’-H" exchange and alka
linizes the eytoplasm.* These ionie responses to IP,
and diacylglycerol are believed to play an important.
role in the proliferative response to thrombin.”
