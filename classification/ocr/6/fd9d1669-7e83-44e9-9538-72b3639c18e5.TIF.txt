Only 10 different Vy gene segments were found when the sequences of 15 variable (Vg) genes of the mouse T-cell receptor
were examined. From this analysis we calculate that the total number of expressed Vp gene segments may be 21 or fewer,
which makes the expressed germline V, repertoire much smaller than that of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain or ligh-chain

aenes. We suggest that B-chain somatic diversification is concentrated at the Vj-Dg-Jp junctions

BOTH the Ticell receptor and the immunoglobulins are
heterogeneous cell-surface glycoproteins that can recognize
many antigens’. It is clear ftom genomic analysis that they
share similar strategies for diversification, “T-cell receptor
molecules are composed of o- and B-chains, each of which,
like the immunoglobulin chains, is divided into variable (V) and
constant (C) regions», The V regions together form the antigen-
binding domain. The B-chain genes of the mouse are the most
thoroughly. studied Tell" receptor genes. Like the
immunozlobulin genes, they are divided imto separate Vp ver-
sity (Dy and joining (J) gene segments that are assembled hy

Tecell antigen recognition differs from that mediated by
immunoglobulins in that T cells must recognize antigen in the
context of a cell-surface molecule encoded by the major his-
tocompatibilty complex (MHC), a phenomenon termed MHC.
restiction’™'", T-cytotoxic (Te) cells, which ste capable of
Killing virus-infected and tumour cells, are mainly restricted by
class I gene products of the MHC™. T-helper (Ty) cells, which
fare capable of enhancing B- or T-cell responses, are mainly
restricted by class II MHC gene products T-cell receptor
diversification mus therefore accommodate antigen recognition
and recognition of highly polymorphic determinants on MHC
molecules,

‘To determine the extent of T-cell receptor diversity and its
relationship to antigen MHC recognition, we analysed eight Vp
genes from complementary DNA libraries of functional T ces
fand thymocytes. We have compared these Vp gene sequences
with seven from the literature and find that: (1) the expressed
Vp gene ceperioite is probably small, pechaps less than 21
members: (2) Vp protein segments are structurally similar to
‘immunoglobulin V segments: and (3) there is no simple correla
tion between antigen and MHC specificity and the use of par-
tievlar chain gene segments
