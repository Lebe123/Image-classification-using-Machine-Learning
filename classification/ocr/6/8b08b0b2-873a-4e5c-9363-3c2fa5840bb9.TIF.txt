CTP RE ate sndications that ethanol may af-
fect the central nervous system (CNS) by
altering the physicochemical properties of new
tonal membranes and/or_membrane-bound
proteins. The antagonism of ethanol narcosis by
hyperbaric pressures" has been proposed to be
due to opposing effects of ethanol and hyper
banc pressure on membrane fluidity which in
turn affects an undelermined anesthetic site.
Membrane fluidity has been shown to increase
‘at nonlethal ethanol concentrations.’ although
the physiological relevarice of the magnitude of
such increases has been questioned.> Synaptic
‘membranes from ethanol-tolerant mice are re
sistant to the fluidizing effects of ethanol and
‘evidence exists that this resistance resides in the
Lipid composition of the membranes.’ Mice with
reduced cholesterol are incapable of developing,
tolerance to ethanol,* and mice given a diet of
highly saturated lipids have different membrane
compositions and responses to cthanol® Thus,
the physical state of neuronal membranes ap:

Clinical studies have indicated that chrome
alcoholics require higher doses of general anes
thetics to achieve surgical anesthesia,"*"? Fur
ther evidence for cross-tolerance between
ethanol and general anesthetics was shown by
Koblin etal. who demonstrated that mice tok
erant to nitrous oxide are also tolerant to
ethanol. Many proposed mechanisms of anes:
thesia are based on perturbations of the physi-
cochemisiry of lipid bilayers" and, hence, fur-
ther link the actions of ethanol to physicochem:
seal phenomena,

‘Because environmental temperatures can be
varied. the isolated perfused mouse brain
(OPMB) preparation provides a unique oppor-
tunity to study thermal effects on the neuro:
chemsstry of an intact mammalian brain. Thus,
