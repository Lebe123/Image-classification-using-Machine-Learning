‘The first 79 residues of the yeast Bte2p G protein-
coupled pheromone receptor, Including the negatively
charged N-terminal domain, the firet transmembrane
segment, and the following positively charged eytoplas-
imc loop, has been fused to a Kex2p-cleavable Prlacta-
‘ase reporter. Insertion orientation was determined by
‘analysis of cell-associated and secreted flactamase ac-
tivities and independently corroborated by analysis of
membrane association and glycosylation patterns. This
fusion inserts with exclusively N terminus exofacial
(5) topology, serving as a model type II! membrane
protein. Orientation is unaffected by removal of all
three positively charged residues in the cytoplasmic
loop or by deletion of all but 12 residues from the N-
terminal domain. The residual —2 Neerminal charge
apperently provides a signal sufficient to determine
Nass topology. This is entirely consistent with the tatle
tically derived rule in which the charge difference,
A(C-N), counted for the 15 immediately flanking real:
ues, is the primary topology determinant. Mutations
altering A(C-N) to zero favors Noxy insertion by 8 to 1,
whereas increasingly negative values cause increasing
inversion of orientation. All results are consistent with
the charge difference rule and indicate that whereas pos-
itive charges promote eytoplaamle retention, negative
charges promote translocation.
