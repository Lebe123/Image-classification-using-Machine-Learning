2.2 The Fundamentals behind the TLVs

The ACGIH TLVs and most other OELs are limits that refer to airborne concentrations of
substances and represent conditions under which "it is believed that nearly all workers may be
repeatedly exposed day-after-day without adverse health effects" ((4) ACGIH, 1992). It is important to
recognize that unlike some exposure limits for ambient air pollutants, contaminated water, or food
additives set by other professional groups or regulatory agencies, exposure to the TLV will not
necessarily prevent discomfort or injury for everyone who is exposed ((7) Adkins et al., 1990). The
ACGIH recognized long ago that because of the wide range in individual susceptibility, a small
percentage of workers may experience discomfort from some substances at concentrations at or below
the threshold limit and that a smaller percentage may be affected more seriously by aggravation of a
preexisting condition or by development of an occupational illness (47) Cooper, 1973; (140) Omenn,
1982; (4) ACGIH, 1992). This is clearly stated in the introduction to the ACGIH's annual booklet
“Threshold Limit Values for Chemical Substances and Physical Agents and Biological Exposure
Indices" ((4) ACGIH, 1992). :

This limitation, although perhaps less than ideal, has been considered a practical one since
airborne concentrations so low as to protect hypersusceptibles have traditionally been judged
infeasible due to either engineering or economic limitations. This shortcoming in the TLVs has, until
the past 4 years, not been considered a serious one. If society wishes to significantly reduce
workplace exposures, by using engineering controls and personal protective equipment, it is now
possible to do so. In light of the dramatic improvements of the past 10 years in our analytical
capabilities, personal monitoring/sampling devices, biological monitoring techniques, and the use of
robots as a plausible engineering control, we are now technologically able to consider more stringent
occupational exposure limits. Whether we are willing to invest the financial resources needed to
control workplace exposure to much lower levels or whether it makes good economic sense to do so is
not yet known ((222) U.S. EPA SAB, 1990).

 

Threshold limit values, like most other OELs used in other countries, are based on the best
available information from industrial experience, experimental human and animal studies, and, when
possible, from a combination of the three ((196) Smith and Olishifski, 1988; (4) ACGIH, 1992). The
rationale for each of the values differs from substance to substance. For example, protection against
impairment of health may be a guiding factor for some, whereas reasonable freedom from irritation,
narcosis, nuisance, or other forms of stress may form the basis for others. The age and completeness
of the information available for establishing most occupational exposure limits also varies from
substance to substance; consequently, the precision of each particular TLV is subject to variation. The
most recent TLV and its documentation should always be consulted in order to evaluate the quality of
the data upon which that value was set.

The background information and rationale for each TLV is published periodically in the
Documentation of the Threshold Limit Values (ACGIH, 1989). Some type of documentation is
‘occasionally available for OELs set in other countries. The rationale or documentation for a particular
OEL should always be consulted before interpreting or adjusting an exposure limit, as well as the
specific data considered in establishing it ((4) ACGIH, 1992).

Even though all of the publications that contain OELs emphasize that they were intended for use
only in establishing safe levels of exposure for persons in the workplace, they have been used at times
in other situations. itis for this reason that all exposure limits should be interpreted and applied only by
someone knowledgeable of industrial hygiene and toxicology. The TLV committee did not intend that
they be used, or modified for use:
