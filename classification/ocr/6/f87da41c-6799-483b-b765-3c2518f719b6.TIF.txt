‘The mutagenicity for mammalian cells of five nalkanals
produced by lipid peroxidation was tested in V79 Chinese
hamster lung ‘cells either at the hypoxanthine-guanine
_Dhosphorbossitranserase locus as resistance to 6-thioguanine
‘or at the NaiK ATPase locus as resistance to ouabain. The
results show that propanal, butanal, pentanal and hexanal
induced a dose-dependent increase in the frequency over
controls ofboth 6-thioguanine- and ouabain-resstnt mutants
a concentrations ranging from 3 t0 30 mM. With aonanal
the same effects were observed with concentrations of
01-03 mM.

Introduction

‘The demonstrated interaction of lipid peroxidation products with
DNA, recently reviewed by Vaca eal, 1988), provides indirect
evidence in support of a causal relationship between the free
radical-induced  peroxidative breakdown of biomembrane
polyunsaturated faty acids and the iniation and/or promotion
‘of carcinogenesis. Concerning the iitiaton phase, this interaction
‘would be of biological significance asa source of mutations. Some
‘of the terminal non-radical products of lipid peroxidation have
been found to behave as genotoxic ina variety of short-term tests
(Vaca tal, 1988). However, the studies performed until now
to assess their mutagenicity in manmalian celis are restricted to
malondialdehyde (Yau, 1979) and 4-hydroxynonenal(Cejelli et
4, 1987, whieh have been shown to induce a dose-dependent
increase of mutation frequency in LS178Y murine iymphoma
cells and in V79 Chinese hamster eels respectively. tn contrast,
any information On the mutagenic activity in mammalian cells
‘of the other aldehydes generated by ipd peroxidation is absent.
‘Among them, r-alkanals represent the major elass of non-polar
‘earbonyl compounds obtained from both rat liver microsomes
‘and intact rat hepatocytes peroxidized with ADP-iron or carbon
tetrachloride (Esterbauer er al, 1982; Poli et a, 1985), in
preliminary experiments evidence has been acquired that
Propanal, butanal and hexanal inerease the frequency of
‘hioguanine-resistan mutans in V79 cells, and that the former
induces DNA repair synthesis in rat hepatocyte primary cultures
Brambilla etal, 1988). The present work was undertaken to
compare five n-alkanals-propanal, butanal, pentanal, hexanal
and nonanai—for their capability of inducing forward mutations
in V79 cells. The two selection systems wsed were the resistance
to Gthioguanine and the resistance 10 ouabain, which are
considered to compiement each other (Arlt eral, 1978; Bradley
eval, 1981),

Results

‘The data of Table I show that a dose-dependent reduction in the
fraction of surviving cells was produced by propanal, butanal,
pentanal and hexanal concentrations increasing from 1—3 %0
30-90 mM, Nonanal was markedly mote cytotoxic, a reduction
of cell viability being already present ater exposure to 0.3 mM.
With all the five alkanals the relative plating efficiency was
reduced to <1% by concentrations 3-fold higher than those listed
in Table T (data not shown).

The results of the mutagenicity assays (Table 1), carried out
‘up to maximal concentrations that did not proxivce a drastic
seduction of plating efficiency, showed that all the five alkanals
induced a dose-dependent increase in the mutation frequency
either at the HGPRT locus, with TG as the selective agent, oF
atthe NvK locus, with OUA as the selective agent. The range
of effective concentrations was 3~30 mM for propanal, butanal,
pentanal and hexanal, and 0.10.3 mM for nonanal. NMU and
EMS, employed as postive controls at doses producing similar

lutions of plating efficiency, yielded a higher frequency of
‘TG! and OUA’ variants respectively. The mutagenic poteacies
