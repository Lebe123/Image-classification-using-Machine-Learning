ABSTRACT

 

Tobacco-specific nonvolatile N-nitrosamines in tobacco and
in tresh mainstream and sidestveam smoke of cigarettes and
cigars were quantitatively determined with a thermal energy
‘analyzer. The smoke was trapped in ascorbic acid solution
Dutflered at pl 4.$ and extracted with cichloromethane, and
the organic phase was chromatographed and analyzed by
high-performance liquid chromatography-thermal energy ani
lyzer methodology (sensitivity. 250 pg/injection). The nonvol-
ale nitrosamines were further enriched by repeated chroma-
tography and positively identified by gas-liquid chrometogra-
Dhy-mass spectrometry. (2'-"C]N’-nitrosonornicotine serves
2s internal standard for the quaniitative analysis.

‘The tobacco of five sitferent cigarettes contained between
0.22 end 7.0 pom of the carcinogenic N'-nitesonomicotine,
0.43: and 0.74 ppm of the carcinogenic 44{N-methy-enic
tosamino)-143-pyridy)-1-butanone, and 0.64 to 3.2 pom of
the newty identified N"-nitrosoanatabine. In unaged mainstream
land sidesireem smoke of the same cigarettes, values ranged
between 0.24 and 3.7 and'0.18 and'6.1 ug/eigarette for N=
‘itrosonornicotine, between 0.11| and 0.<2 and 0.19 anc 0.66
uaeigarette for £4 N-methyl-N-nitrosamino)-1-3-pyticyl
utanone, and between 0.33 and <.6 and 0.18 and 1.5 49/
cigarette for N'-nitrosoanstebine, respectively. The relatively
high concentrations of these carcinogenic N-nitrossmines in
sidestream smoke are discussed as possible tobacco-speciic
ingicators for indoor pollution.

‘This study reports quantitative data for NNN, NNK, and the

in the uneged mainstream smoke of cigarettes and cigars.

tobacco in between putts, frequently contains higher concen

MATERIALS AND METHOOS

Apparatus. The generation of maiestream smoke of cigs
‘eles. itl cigars, and cigars hes been described in previous
publication (15). The small sidesiream smoke collector used
for cigarettes and itil cigars (3, 4) and a large collector tor
‘cigars (28) required regulation ofthe airtow to 25 mil/see. This

the mainstream smoke was generated Sy a single-por piston,
