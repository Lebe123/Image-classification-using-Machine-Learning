ABSTRACT

We describe a new exonuclease-based method for
joining and/or constructing two or more DNA
molecules. DNA fragments containing ends
complementary to those of a vector or another
independent molecules were generated by the
polymerase chain. reaction. The 3’ ends of these
‘molecules as well as the vector DNA were then
recessed by exonuclease activity and annealed in an
orientation-determined manner via thelr complemen-
tary single-stranded regions. This recombinant DNA
an be transformed directly into bacteria without a
further ligase-dependent reaction. Using this approach,
We have constructed recombinant DNA molecules
rapidly, efficiently and directionally. This method can
effectively replace conventional protocols for PCR
cloning, PCR SOEing, DNA subcloning and site-
directed mutagenesis.

 

INTRODUCTION

‘The use ofthe polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in nucleic acid
esearch has provided a convenient way to amplify and construct,
genes. In most cases, subcloning of PCR products is required
for further manipulation and generally involves the incorporation
of restriction sites a the ends of PCR products (1,2), or blunt.
ended ligation of PCR products into the vector (3). However,
cloning of PCR products is often less straightforward than
anticipated. The main problems which need tobe solved in blunt
ended cloning of PCR products include the removal of extra
‘nucleotides added tothe 3” ends by Taq DNA polymerase (3,4),
the prevention of non-recombinant backgrounds, and the low
efficiency of the blunt-end ligation reaction, The T/A cloning
system (Invitrogen) has been used to overcome the extra
‘nucleotide problem at the 3” end but an extra dAMP is
‘automatically inserted. This generates. additional problems
especialy in expression studies a twill alter the reading fame.
Cohesive end cloning (provided by the incorporation of restriction
sites at the 5’ end of PCR primers) is a good altemative to blunt
tend cloning. Nonetheless, both methods require several steps of
DNA fragment purification, ligase-dependent ligation and colony

 

selection to determine the correct orientation of the insert and
ate labor intensive, time consuming and/or of low efficiency.

Strategies for ligase-free cloning of PCR products have been
developed to overcome some of these problems. The recombinant
circle PCR (RCPCR) technique generates circular DNA through
hhterologous annealing of sequence-overlapped ends on different
PCR products (5,6). These circular DNA forms can be
transformed direty into bacteria without a ligation procedure.
However, this method requires either multiple sets of PCR
primers ‘or PCR reamplificaton of  sequence-overlapped
‘molecules to splice insert and vector DNA togethet (7). Also
in these applications, both insert and vector DNA must be
amplified. Vector DNA amplification adds to the limitation on
the size ofthe DNA fragment that can be amplified by Taq DNA.
polymerase. An alterate strategy isto create sequence specific,
single-stranded ends on both PCR products of inset and vector
ends (6~10), then splice them through a sequence homologous
annealing process. In most applications, single-stranded ends are
generated by the 3’ to 5" exonuclease activity of T4 DNA
polymerase (8,9) with the overlapped sequence specifically
Sesigned and incorporated into PCR primers for both insert as
well as vector DNA amplification. A specified, unique length
of 3 recessed ends is then created in the presence of specific
NTP and T4 DNA polymerase and the circular form of DNA,
“Sxembled through sequence overlapped ends, is then ready for
transformation. An alternative way to produce single-stranded
ends employs uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG). This enzyme
cleaves all €UMPs which ae incorporated into the PCR primers
(11), However, some of these methods, like RCPCR, require
ther multiple BCR primer ses, vector amplification, or vector
end sequence modifications. Others require a double restriction
enzyme cleavage of vector DNA followed bya ligation process
for directional cloning (9,10)

Recently we developed a simple exonuclease-based strategy
to construct PCR products. Ths protocol has the advantages of
the Tigasevfree PCR cloning technique but none of the
sisadvantages, such as vector amplification, enzymatic
‘manipulation or lack of directional cloning. Here we document
its application for constructing bacterial gene fusion mutans for
‘an octamer binding protein (12)
