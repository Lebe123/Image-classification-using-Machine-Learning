Hately, many clinicians are not cog
nizant of the extant pleiotropy of ean
cerprone genes, some of which may
predispose to a bizarre spectrom of
‘cancer types within a given family and
which, on occasion, may involve all
three germinal layers. The age st on-
fet of a specific cancer may also be
extremely variable in hereditary
forms of eancer, although the average

‘Most studies of cancer in children,
ineluding the Oxford Survey of Child.
hhood Cancer. have focused almost ex-
clusively om cancers of infancy and
<hildhood. They have given only lim-
ited attention to.ancerin family mem
bers. When hereditary factors have
‘been considered, indepth evaluation
‘of cancer inadults hae often been given
little attention. Hence, those heredi
tary cancer syndromes that are char.
acterized by doth childhood- and adult-
onset cancers have been frequently
missed. However, one noteworthy ex.
ception is the recent study by Birch
cet al in which the health status or
‘cause of death in the mothers of 143
children with soft-tissue sarcomas
‘were thoroughly investigated, Inter
estingly, six of these mothers had the
Premenopausal onset of breast cancer
and two of them had bilateral disease.
This represented a threefold excess
risk of breast cancer.

We previously described an ex-
tended kindred that showed a broad
‘spectrum of cancer; namely, sarcoma,
breast cancer and brain tumors, lung
cancer, laryngeal carcinoma, leuke-
mia, and adrenocortical earcinoma,
which we referred to as the SBLA
ayndrome.* This disorder had been

previously discovered in four nuclear
Kindreds by Li and Fraumeni” who
‘eubsequently published a prospective
‘observation of these families that cov.
ered a Wyear time frame (969
through 1961)* Of interest was the fact
that in 31 surviving family members,
36 additional cancers developed (the
expected number was 0.6) Five of
these were carcinomas of the breast,
four were soft-tissue sarcomas, and
seven were cancers at other anatomic
sites. Eight of the patients had multi-
ple primary eancers. Four eancers oc.
curred at sites of prior radiatherapy
(three soft-tissue sarcomas and one
mesothelioma).

‘Our purpose is to describe two sib-
lings who were affected by cancer:
namely,  G-yearold boy with rhab-
omyosarcoma, and his sister, who
died at the age of 11 year with a
stioblastoma. These children repre-
‘sent a fourth generation ‘with ayn
rome cancers in the original kindred
with the SBLA syndrome.*
