Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy has been used to probe the active site of bacterial ferric cytochrome
P-45Qcauq- The endogenous sixth ligand to the heme iron has been displaced by an extensive series of
‘exogenous oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and other neutral and anionic donor ligands in an attempt to examine
systematically the steric and electronic factors that influence the coupling of the heme chromoplore to its
Protein environment. General trends for each ligand class are reported and discussed. Both the wavelengths
and the intensities of the CD bands vary with ligand type and structure, All but one of the complexes exhibit
negative CD maxima in their delta and Soret bands. Comparison to ferric myoglobin-thiolate complexes
Indicates that the negative sign observed for the cytochrome P-450 spectra is not a property of the thiolate
fifth ligand, but rather arises from a different interaction of the cytochrome P-4S0 heme with its protein
‘environment. Complexes with neutral oxygen donors display CD spectra that most closely resemble the
spectrum of the native low-spin enzyme. Hyperporphyrin (split Soret) cytochrome P-480 complexes with
thiolates, phosphines and cyanide trans to cysteinate have complex CD spectra, reflecting the intrinsic
‘on-degeneracy of the Soret ror® transitions. The extensive work presented herein provides am empirical
foundation for use in analyzing the interaction of heme chromophores with their protein surroundimgs, not
‘only for the cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases but also for heme proteins in general.

[1-3]. Recent work supports an endogenous al-
cobol-containing amino acid, or possibly water, as
the sixth ligand to the native ferric enzyme (2,46).

Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy is unique
in its sensitivity to both the heme electronic struc-
ture and its coupling with the optically active
protein environment {7,8}. The highly symmetrical
hheme chromophore is normally optically inactive
[8.9]; however, perturbations of a protein-bound
hheme lead to dissymmetry and produce the so-
called ‘induced’ CD effect. CD features in the
