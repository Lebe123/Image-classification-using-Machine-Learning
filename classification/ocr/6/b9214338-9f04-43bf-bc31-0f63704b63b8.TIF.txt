Vanudate Vy markedly stimulnted the oxidation of
NADPH by GSSG reductase and this oxidation was wc~
‘companied by the consumption of 0; and the accumula:
tion of H,0;, Superoxide diemvtaren completely elimi-
nated thin effect of Viv, Whereas catalase was without
effect, a5 was exogenous H;0; added to 0.1 mM. These
‘effects could be seen equally well
(2-bydroxyetby!)- 1-piper
fered solutions. Under
no Venratimalated oxida
‘of the electrons flowing from NADPH to O,, through,
GSSG reductase, resulted in release of O,. The avernie

‘auth of the free radical chaina causing the oxidation of
NADPH, initiated by O, plus Vi, was caleulated to be
a the range 140-200 NADPH oxidized per 0; intro-
duced, We conclude that GSSG reductase, and by exten:

‘The SOD*inhibitable reduction of cytochrome ¢ is
‘convenient means of measuring O production. Soon after
description (1-3) this method was applied by Massey
‘et al (4) to 8 number of flavoenzymes. These workers
found that favoprotein dehydrogenases, including GSSG.

reductase, lipoyl dehydrogenase, and ferredoxin:NADP
oxidoreductase, could generate Oj, whereas flavoprotein
oxidases did not do so to # detectable degree. More re
cently we have shown that O; plus Viv) initiates a free
radical chain oxidation of NAD(P)H (5-11). Because
chain reactions amplify the consequences of the initiating
event, in proportion to the average chain length, Viv) en:
hhances the rate of oxidation of NAD(P)H in any system
generating O;. This, rather than Vivy-dependent
NAD(P)H oxidases, is the basie of the frequently reported
Vyyratimulated oxidation of NAD(P)H by bivloxical
membranes.

‘Since GSSG reductase, lipoyl dehydrogenase, and fer.
redoxin:NADP” oxidoreductase can generate O; (4) it
follows that they. like all other sources of O; (5-14),
should exhibit a Viv, stimulation of NAD(P)H oxidation,
Shi and Dalal (18, 16) have recently affirmed this expec:
tation; however, they somehow failed to observe inhibition
of NADPH oxidation by SOD and concluded that these
flavoenzymes were acting as NADPH:Viy) oxidoreduc:
teren. They further claimed that Vay accumulated in
aerobic phosphate: buffered solutions. Since Vay, rapidly
‘autoxidizes under these conditions producing Oy (11-14,
17), this too represents @ contradiction of a substantial
body of work

Carefal reexamination of the Viv) stimulation of
NADIP)H by GSSG reductase seemed to be in order. We
now describe experiments which indicate that GSSG re
ductase does release O,, in agreement with Massey et al.
(4), and that this O, is the basis of the Viv, enhancement
‘of NAD(P)H oxidation, which occurs by’ a free radical
chain reaction whose chain length enn exceed 100.
