Infection by bovine Jeukemia virus (BLV) Is characterized by a long latency period, after which some
individuals develop B-cell mors. The behavior of BL and related retroviruses during the latency period
Detween initial infection and subsequent tumorigenesis Is poorly understood. We used in situ hybridization to
detect BLV transcripts In individual peripheral bloed mononuclear cells from experimentally infected,
‘asymptomatic sheep with latent infections. Viral RNA was not found in most peripheral blood cells that had
been isolated as rapidly as possible from circulating blood, but it was. present in rare cells. BLY RNA
transcripts increased in a biphasic manner within a few hours after the blood cells were placed in culture.
Exposure to fetal bovine serum was identified as the principal cause of this transcriptional activation, which
‘occurred in fewer than 1 in 1,000 cells. Agents knovn to activate immune cells polyclonally caused a further
increase inthe numberof cells containing BLY RNA within §h. In some cases, the numbers of vial transcripts,
within individual cells also increased. Thus, BLY is not detectably expressed io most resting lymphocytes,
‘ireulating in the blood, but its transcription is activated by components of fetal bovine serum and can be
augmented by molecules that mine activation of immune cells. This activation, which might occur in lymphoid
{Ussue during an imouune response, may lead to the synthesis of viral regulatory proteins that are thought (o

Bovine leukemia virus (BLY), human T-cell leukemia
virus types I and Il (HTLV-I and HTLV-lI, respectively),
and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) ate all retrovi-
rises that replicate in cells of the immune system. Infection
by these viruses is followed by a long latency period, and a
certain proportion of infected individuals then rapidly prog-
ress to terminal disease. Because these viruses integrate
essentially at random into the host genome and do not
contain cell-derived oncogenes, it is thought that the viral
gene products themselves lead to development of disease
‘The genomes of BLV, HTLY, and HIV encode crans-acting
factors that regulate viral transcription, but litle is known
about how viral transcripts that encode these regulatory
proteins are initially induced. For HIV, recent evidence
‘Suggests that immune responses to unrelated antigens trigger
virus replication and contribute (o disease progression (re-
viewed in reference 15).

BLY, HTLY-I and HTLV-t are tumorigenic retroviruses
that cause leukemia and lymphoma (reviewed in references 4
‘and 53) and are distinet from HIV, a lentivirus that causes
fatal immunodeficiency and neuropathy of the central ner-
‘vous system (reviewed in reference 15). BLV and HTLV-I
share numerous features of infection and pathology. They
also have similar genomic structures (43) and use common
‘strategies for gene expression. The 3” ends ofthe genomes of|
HTLV and BLY contain the X sequences encoding a set of|
novel proteins (30, 39, 41, 45) that are necessary for ecient
transcription from the viral promoter (7, 11, 40) and that
determine the relative proportions of spliced and unspliced
transcripts (12, 25, 27). Aside from host range, a notable
difference between the two viruses is that BLV infection is
associated with malignancy of B cells, whereas HTLV
affects T cell.

‘Tumor cells contain at least part of one provirus, but the
viral genome is not detectably expressed (16, 28), which
suggests that viral gene products are not necessary 10
maintain the transformed state. The X proteins encoded by
the virus may set in motion a series of events leading 10
secondary genetic changes that result in malignant transfor-
mation (54). Its important for two reasons to know where
‘and under what conditions viral genes are expressed before
tumor development begins. () Intermittent production and
spread of the virus would favor transformation simply by
increasing the population of cells at risk for such a genetic
change. (i) It is possible that the X-encoded proteins, tax
and rex, could be produced from a subgenomic message
without production of virions and that tax itself is responsi
ble for changes in cells that could lead to uncontrolled
srowth (19, 26, 33)

BLV-specific RNAS have not previously been detected in
RNA extracted from populations of monontclear cells newly
purified from the blood of infected animals (20,29), but BLY
Ueanscripts were detected once these cells’ had been ia
short-term culture (20). However, low-level transcription in
«few cells might escape detection unless individual cells
were examined for viral transcripts, Virion proteins and
particles have been detected in a few cells as early as 3 to 6
bb after initiation of blood cell cultures but were most
abundant after 24 to 48 h of culture (3, 14, 49).

To examine infected cells during the latency period, when
virus expression is likely to be important in disease devel-
opment, we studied transcriptional activation of the BLY
provirus in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
from infected but asymptomatic sheep that had no elevation
of lymphocyte counts. We have found that the number of
cells that act as infectious centers in culture is extremely low
during latency. typially about 1 in 10* cells (submitted for
