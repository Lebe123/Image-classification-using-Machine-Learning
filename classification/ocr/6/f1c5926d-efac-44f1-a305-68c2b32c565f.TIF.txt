thattopolsomeras activity is equired continuously for contine-

the necessary function. Only when the activity ofboth enzymes

Topoisomerase II may act behind the replication fork, passing
teplicated double-strand DNA segments through each other to
disentangle them, whereas topoisomerase I acts by nicking and
closing DNA ahead of the fork’

‘We also tested whether the double mutant was defective in
RNA synthesis. The rate of RNA synthesis was compared for
‘wild-type strain, the topoisomerase single mutants and the
‘double mutant, Figure 2 shows that all fou strains show a rapid
decrease in the rate of RNA synthesis after a shift (0 37°C. This
inhibition is transient and due to heat shock. The wild-type
strain and exch of the single top mutants recover from heat
shock in about one hour and resume normal RNA synthesis.
‘After (wo houes at 37°C the top? ts mutant shows another
‘eduction inthe rate of RNA synthesis. This occurs atthe time
cells begin to die a they atempt to segregate their intertwined
{chromosomes at mitosis". The top! 10p? double motant, on the
‘other hand, never resumes a normal rate of RNA synthesis,
levelling off at 10% of the initial rate (Fig. 2)

‘As an intial attempt to discover which transcription units
were most affected in the double mutant, RNA pulse-labelied

pools on an oligo(4T)-cellulose column. The poly(A)" poot
