‘Smoking is an important cause of per-operative morbidity
(i), During both induetion and instrumentation of the
airway. smokers appear more likely than non-smokers 19
suffer laryngospasm and episodes Of airway obstruction
leading 10 a reduction in oxygen saturation. Chronic
cigarette smokers have been shown to demonstrate
hyper-reactivity of upper airway celeres when tested with
dilute ammonia vapour (2)

‘The deleterious effecs of parental smoking on the
respiratory tracts of children are becoming increasingly
‘recognised. Studies have shown an incteased incidence of
Wwheezines in infancy [3] and asthma in later childhood [4
in children who are passive smokers. They tend to have
abnormal pulmonary function tests {8} and an increased
incidence of respiratory tract infections (6), Evidence from
ear, note and throat clinics indicates that parental smoking.
is associated with an increased ineidence of tonsillectomy [7]
and a poorer outcome from treatment of glue cut (8)

Children with upper cespiratory tract infections ate
more fikely to suffer adverse events during anaesthesia

 

 

because of increased upper airsay retlees [9 but there hs
‘been litle work done to assess the effect of passive smoking
‘onthe incidence of airway complications during anuesthesis
in children. The aim of this study was (0 evaluate the
relationship between exposure 10 cigarette smoke and the
incidence and seventy of aicway complications during
several anaesthesia.

 

Methods

‘One hundred and twenty-five ASA | and 2 children
scheduled for elective daycase surgery under general
anaesthesia, aged between one and 1? years. were enrolled
in the study. Institutional ethies committee approval und
informed parental consent were obtained. Children were
fot enrolled if they had had a respiratory teact infection
Within the previous 2 weeks. any upper or lower airway
pathology. neuromuscular disease oF any disease process
Tikely to interfere with the normal mechanies of respiration.
