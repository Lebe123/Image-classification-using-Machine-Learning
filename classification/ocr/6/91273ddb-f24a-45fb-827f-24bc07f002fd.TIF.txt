ABSTRACT Two related polypeptides, Hl and H2, com-
prise the human asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-). Stable
lines of murine NIH 373 fibroblasts expressing Hi alone or H2.

(ASOR), which contains triantennary oligosaccharides. In

{scoexpressed, Hl ls synthesized as a40-kDa precursor bearing
bigh-mannose processed toits mature 46-KDa
form, and transported to the cell surface. In cells expressing
only #1, homodimers and -tcimers of HI are formed. In
contrast, when expressed in 373 cells without Ht, H2 is
synthesized as its 43-kDa precursor, bearing high-mannose
‘oligosaccharides, but israpldly degraded, When HI and H2.are
‘coexpressed inthe same cell the Ht polypeptide “rescues” the
2 polypeptide; H2 is processed to its characteristic S0-kDa
‘mature form and is transported to the surface. We conclude
that the human ASGP-R is a moltichain beterooligomer,
probably a trimer of HI molecules in noncovalent association
with one, two, or three H2 molecules, and that the two
polypeptides normally interact early in biosynthesis.

‘The hepatocyte asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R) binds
with high-affinity serum glycoproteins bearing multiple ter-
minal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residues. It has
served as a model for many of the events of receplor-
mediated endocytosis, such as ligand binding, receptor—
ligand dissociation and sorting, and recycling ofthe receptor
to the cell surface (1-3). The human ASGP-R, purified from
liver or the hepatoma cell line HepG2, was thought to be
composed only of a single 46-kDa polypeptide, designated
HL. However, by cDNA cloning (4, 5) and direct identfica-
tion (6), second and less abundant human ASGP-R molec-
‘lar species, H2 (49-50 kDa), has been characterized. Are
these two human ASGP-R polypeptides independent recep-
tors with different functions and specificities, or do they only
together comprise a functional ASGI

McPhaul and Berg (7) demonstrated that Expression of
both rat ASGP-R cDNAs, rat hepatic lectin (RHL)-1 and
RHL-2/-3, is required to form a functional ASGP-R in rat
HTC cells, one that can internalize and accumulate in
lysosomes fluorescent-labeled asialoorosomucoid (ASOR).
‘Sawyer et al. (8) showed that plasma membrane RHL-1 and
RHL-2/-3 peptides do interact noncovalently. In contrast, on
the basis of chemical crosslinking and galactose affinity
‘chromatography studies, Drickamer and his colleagues
‘cluded that the at ASGP-R polypeptides associate only into
distinct homooligomers of RHL-1 or RHL-2/-3 (9). In par
ticular, they could not chemically cross-link RL-1 with

peptide to isel to form homooligomers ©).

‘Using chemical cross-linking and antibody-induced degra-
ation protocols, we showed that, in HepG2 els, Hl and H2
form a heterooligomer (10). Here we examine the fate ofthe
individual polypeptides in singly transfected mouse NIH 3T3
cells or in 313 cells that express both human ASGP-R
polypeptides. We propose a model ofthe ASGP-R structure
in which a “core” trimer of HI molecules can interact with
‘one, two, of three H2 molecules. Although the exact stoi
chiometry of the interactions between H1 and H2 is stl
tunknown, itis clear that these polypeptides must interact
carly in biosynthesis to assemble a functional ASGP-R.

 

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Construction of pDOL-ASGP-R. All DNA manipulations
involved standard techniques (1). The retroviral expression
vector pDO-L was kindly provided by A. Korman, C. Cepko,
and RC. Mulgan of he Whitehead Institute (12). The entre
coding regions of Hl and H2 were excised from the plasmids
pSAL-and pSA2 (4, §) and ligated into the Bamdil site of
PDO-L via Bg! I and BamEt inkers, respectively.

Introduction of ASGP-R Polypeptides into NIH 373 Cells.
‘Tea micrograms of pDOL-H1, pDOL-H2, or pDOL. without
insert DNA was used to transform y-2 cells (12, 13) as
described by Deitcher eal. (14). The transient viral super
natant was sed to infect NIH 3T3 cell, which were selected
for GAs resistance and cloned as described (12, 14). Cell
lines engineered to contain both ASGP-R polypeptides were
sade by einfecting a parental cell ine with the appropriate
{eansient viral supematant followed by dilution cloning
CGiones wer screened forthe presence ofthe H2 or H1 cDNA
by differential hybridization, using the cytoplasmic dot blot
procedure of White and Bancroft (15) and the hybridization
conditions described by Spiess and Lodish (5).

Ligand Binding, Uptake, and Degradation Aseay. Human
crosomucoid (Sigma) was desialylated as described except
that Hepesbuffered saline (HBS) (50 mM Hepes/41 mbt
NaCY/3.8 mM KCI, pH adjusted to 7.41 with NaOH) was
used instead of phosphate-buffered solution (16), ASOR was
iodinated with Enzymobeads (BioRad) according (0 the
manufacturer's protocol. The ligand binding uptake and
degradation assay used is similar to that deseribed by
Schwartz etal. Q7, 18) except HIS was used in place of
phosphate-uffered saline.

‘Metabolic Labeling, Confluent or near confluent (75-1007)
cals in Gi-mm tissue culture plates were labeled with
Sleysteine as described (6, 10).

Imm Monolayers of metabolically labeled
cells were washed twice in ice-cold HBS and then lysed with
