‘The yeast-based two hybrid has been used to identify
a novel protein that binds to the intracellular domain of
the type 1 receptor for tumor necrosis factor (TNFR-
IC). The TNF receptor-associated protein, TRAP-1,
shows strong homology to members of the 90-kDa family
fof heat shock proteins. After in vitro transcription!
translation and “*S labeling, TRAP-1 was precipitated
using a fusion protein consisting of glutathione S-trans-
ferase and TNFR-1IC, showing that the two proteins
directly interact, The ability of deletion mutants of

‘TRAP-1 was tested using the
two hybrid system. This showed that the amino acid
sequences that mediate binding are diffusely distrib-
‘uted outside of the domain in the C terminus of TNFR-
LIC that signals cytotoxicity. The 24-kilobase TRAP-1
‘mRNA was variably expressed in skeletal muscle, liver,
heart, brain, kidney, pancreas, lung, and placenta.
‘TTRAP-1 mRNA was also detected in each of eight differ-
cent transformed cell lines. Identification of TRAP-1 may
be an important step toward defining how TNFR-1,
‘which does not contain protein tyrosine kinase activity,
‘transmits its message to signal transduction pathways.

 

 

 

‘Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)* is produced predominantly by
macrophages activated by infections or malignancies (1-3).
‘This potent multifunctional cytokine was frst characterized by
its ability to induce the hemorehagic necrosis and regression of
cancers in animals and by the cytotoxic response that it ean
clict from transformed cells in vitro. Subsequent studies have
shown that through interactions with virtually every type of
cell, TNF also promotes immunity, antiviral responses, inflam-
‘mation, shock, and metabolic alterations, including cachexia,

‘which accompany disease states (1-8). Such diverse and pro-
foundly important functions have made TNF the subject of
intense investigation.

‘The fist step in TNF action is binding to specific receptors
that are expressed on escentially all cells (4~7). Two TNF
receptors have been identified as proteins of 55-kDa (the type 1
receptor, TNFR-1) and 75-kDa (the type 2 receptor, TNFR-2)
(8-11), and their DNAs have been cloned (12-14). The extra-
cellular domains of the TNF receptors share homologies with
‘one another and with a group of eell surface receptors that,
include the FAS antigen, the low affinity NGF receptor, the
‘murine cDNA clone 4-1BB from induced helper and cytolytic T
call, the B cell surface antigen CD40, the OX40 antigen of
activated CD4-positive rat lymphocytes, and the T2 antigen of
the Shope fibroma virus (15). The intracellular domains do not
display sequence similarities and couple to different signal
transduction pathways, For this reason, the receptors induce
distinct responses: TNFR-1 promotes cytotoxicity, fibroblast
proliferation, antiviral responses, and the host defense against
‘microorganisms and pathogens (10, 16-19), TNFR2 plays a
role in cytotoxicity that ia sil being defined (2022), inhibits
early hematopoiesis (28), is involved in the proliferation of
‘monocytes (24), and promtotes the proliferation of cells (28).

‘Neither TNF receptor contains intrinsic protein tyrosine ki-
nase activity or any recognizable motif (1214), which suggests
‘2 mechanism through which the signal inherent in the hor-
‘mone-receptor complex can be transmitted to signaling mech-
‘anisms, This may suggest that associated proteins, rather than
‘the intracellular domain of either TNF receptor, act as essen-
‘al elements in signal transmission, Such accessory molecules
may be cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, exemplified by JAK2,
‘which interacts with the erythropoietin and other receptors
(28), or non-tyrosine kinases, such as gp180, which associates
with the interleukin-6 and other receptors (27). Consistent
with the hypothesis that TRAPS may be important to TNF
action are recent reports deseribing co-precipitation of TNFR-1
‘vith a protein kinase activity (28, 29). The present studies were
initiated to identify proteins that associate with the intracel-
ular domain of TNFR-1 (TNFR-1IC) and might then initiate
sljaal transduction.

"To address this problem, we used the yeast-based two hybrid
system, a method for studying protein-protein interactions (30,
‘30. This method is based on the properties of the yeast GALA
protein, which consists of separable domains that mediate
DNA binding and transcriptional activation. Plasmids encod-
ing two hybrid proteins, one consisting of the GALA binding
domain (GALA-BD) fused to protein X and the other consisting
of the GALA activation domain (GAL4-AD) fused to protein Y,
are cotransformed into yeast. Interaction between these pro-
teins permits transcriptional activation ofan integrated eopy of
the GALAlacZ reporter gone.
