By definition, the eavioument is the aggregate of all external conditions
‘and influences that afect Life and development of an organism; therefore,
feovironmental agents cost not only of totic compounds emitted by heavy
Industry, but alo of drugs used as pesticides or even in medical practice

‘Accumulation seily implier that the rate of appearance is higher than
the rate of disappearsce, Therefore, environmental agents may sccomolate
‘ether in the environment of man (air, wate, food) or in the body of man.
‘The question whether or not foreign compounds can accumulate in the body
‘depends predominantly on thee Behavior n the organism. This s best strated
in heavy smokers. Apart from varios carcinogens, tobacco emoke conEiis mlco-
‘doe and considerable amounts of carbon monoxide. Although both of these

solvent
‘environmental agents may accumulate not only substntly, But alo function-
ally fm the body. In other words, there ts sometimes a complete lack of cor
relation between drug concentration and drug effect. This diferent behavior
‘ean be iTlustrated wit certain pesticides. .

‘Chlorinated hydrocuibons, such as DDT, which ore widely wed es
‘tn agriculture, accumulte substantially in man. Becase of their high fat
selubiity and iow rite of elimination, these compounds are stored predominantly
{n the fat depots. Even the average American adult has accumolated mare than
{50 mg of DDT in his body. Fortunately, the toxicity of DDT fs rather low a
‘mammals, Tesie symptoms in nian have been observed only at oml doses of
‘10-20 g of drug—enoagh to kill more than 1000 tons of Bes.
