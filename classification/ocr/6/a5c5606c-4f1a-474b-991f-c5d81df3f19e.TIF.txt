ABSTRACT

In order to verify the hypothesis that selenium (Se) and vitamin

E (Vit E) could improve male fertility, nine oligoastienoterato-
zoospermic men were supplemented for a period of 6 mo with Se and
Vit E. Compared to the baseline period (presupplementation) of 4 mo,
statistically significant increases were observed for Se and Vit E le
els, sperm motility, percent live, and percent normal spermatozoa,
‘These improvements are likely o be “supplementation-dependent,”
since all of the parameters returned to baseline values during the
posttreatment period. None of the couples reported a pregnancy di
ing the study. The HPLC analysis conducted on the serum of one
the patients showed the existence of at least six different Se-contain-
ing peaks, whose Se content was affected by supplementation. The
mechanism(s) involved in these improvements of semen parameters
is presently under investigation.
