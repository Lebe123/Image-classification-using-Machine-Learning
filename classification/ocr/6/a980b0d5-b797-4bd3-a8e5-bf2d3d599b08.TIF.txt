Research on the genetic, molecular genetic, clinical
features, and natural history of HNPCC has shown
tremendous progress and evolution during the past 25 years.
Specifically, HNPCC's autosomal dominant mode of genetic
transmission has now been documented through linkage stu-
dies of the gene at 2p (MSH2) and at 3p (MLE) with the
cloning of these genes. Also, the tumor spectrum has in-
creased, which now, in addition t0 carcinoma of the colon,
endometrium, stomach, and ovary, includes transitional cell
carcinoma of the ureter and renal pelvis, and adenocarcinomas

* of the small bowel and pancreas. Surveillance and manage-
‘ment protocols for patients at high risk should include full
colonoscopy since 70% of the colon cancers occur in the
proximal colon. Because of the marked excess of synchronous
‘and metachronous colorectal cancers (CRC), no less than a
sublotal colectomy should be performed at the time of ini
CRC. Women, in addition to colonoscopy, require endomet-
rial aspiration biospy. Should they develop CRC and if their
‘procreation is completed, we recommend that they consider
prophylactic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo
‘oophoreciomy at the time of their sublotal colectomy. Now
thatthe deleterious genes at 2p and 3p have been identified, we
‘are offering candidates, in whom the MSH2 or MLHI muta-
tion has been verified, an option of prophylactic subiotal
colectomy as opposed to annual lifetime colonoscopy. With
the development ofthe International Hereditary Nonpolyposis
Colorectal Cancer Collaborative Group, knowledge can be
disseminated worldwide ebout the public health importance of
