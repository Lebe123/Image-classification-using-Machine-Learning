Introduction

It is an honor to have been invited to participate in this
symposium on “'Scientifie Advances in Environmental
Health,” especially sine its purpose is to recognize the
‘many contributions of Dr. Norton Nelson to the develop-
iment of the modern field of environmental health sciences
and to the founding of the Institute of Environmental
Medicine. Through his wisdom, insight, ereativity, oF
ganizational genius and inexhaustible energy, he has
Played a major role in the initiation and development of
many agpeets of environmental health science through-
fut the international scientific eommunity. The nature,
scope, and direction of virtually every major component
of current environmental health science research have
been influenced directly or indireetly by Dr. Nelson's ae-
tivities It is therefore entirely appropriate that this sym
posium has been organized in his honor, and it is a per-
Sonal pleasure for me to have this opportunity to express
‘my admiration, respect, and appreciation for his many
contributions.

aa cal eneral reiective of elevated levels of exposure

In certain respects, the current status of the field of
markers of earcinagen exposure represents a culmination
of efforts to bring together current knowledge about
mechanisms of eareinogenesis and mutagenesis and
Tighly sophisticated analytical methods to detect molecu-
Jur and cellular events that may be predictive of health
risks. This isa very timely and important area of research
endeavor, inasmuch as the process of risk assessment is
finding increasing application by regulatory decision-
rmuking bodies in the process of formulating policies in-
tended to minimize health risks resulting from exposure
to hazardous substances, The process of tisk assessment
requires the use of factual data to define the health effects
of exposure of individuals or of populations to such sub:
stances. By current definitioa, the process of risk assess-
ment includes three elements: hazard identification, dose-
Tesponse assessment, and risk characterization. Ex
posure assessment and epidemiology data are key com-
ponents of the dose-response assessment, the objective

 

 

  

 

br wvhich is to define dose-ineidence relationships for ad-
verse health effects (such as cancer) in human popular
tions. These components, together with animal bioassay
Gata, appropriate extrapolations of information concern
ing dose-effects in animals, and interspecies differences
