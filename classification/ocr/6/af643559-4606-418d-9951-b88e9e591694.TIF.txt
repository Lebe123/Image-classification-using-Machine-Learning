JURING a standard ballistocardiographic smoking test, many different
‘types of circulatory response are found among healthy young adul

Some subjects show hyperreactivity of the blood pressure, heart rate, or cardiae
‘output in various combinations, While others with similar smoking habits show
Tittle change or even a negative responce. The variations in circulatory reactivity
undoubtedly reflect individual differences in homeostasis which may be of con-
siderable importarice, particularly: in regard to susceptibility to future hyper-
tension or coronary artery dincase. In 1988, Herrell demonstrated that certain
Persona with “a tendency toward” hypertension showed dramatic rises of blood
Preasure after omoking a cigarette, and in the eame year, Hines and Roth reported,
that the most marked elevation of blood pressure during a standard emoking
test occurred among patients with essential hypertension. We found that the
degree of change in cardiae output in healthy medical students following amoking
may’ be related to genctic factora.* Thus the offepring of hypertensive parents
showed an exaggerated increase in cardiac output after one cigarette as well a
A greater rise in Dlood pressure and heart rate when compared with the offepring
oftunaffected parente, On the other hand, the offepring of parents with coronary
artery disease showed a more marked diminution in stroke volume and a much
smatler increase iy cardiac output after smoking than did the offepring of un-
Affected parents. Accordingly. differences in reaponse to the smoking test may
be of predictive value in regard to the development of hypertension oF coronary
disease at an carly age, on the one hand, or as an index of longevity and relative
freedom from cardiovascular disease on the other.
