We bave used direet cDNA selection to isolate expressed
sequences from a set of four overlapping YACs, spanning
approximately 470 kb of the chromosomal. interval
17q21 centromeric to BRCAL gene. Thirty-eight non-
overlapping unique cDNA fragments were identified in
this region, Twenty-two of the selected cDNAs showed
complete identity with known genes and expressed
sequence tags. Two of these cDNAs shared sequence
homology with genes known to encode potential DNA
binding motifs and hence could function in transerip-
tional “regulation, The remaining 16 unique eDNA
fragments showed no significant similarity to sequences
in the databases and could potentially encode novel
genes. Northern analysis of the novel CDNAS showed
differential expression in various tissues, supporting the
‘transcribed nature of these sequences, Our results place
the gene for a G-protein coupled receptor (GPR2)
previously mapped to 17q within a 400 kb region on
172i.

Breast cancer affects more than 170 000 individuals per
year in the US and is one of the leading cause of
‘cancer deaths among women. Besides environmental
and other factors, genetic predisposition has been
shown to be an important component in the etiology
of breast cancer, accounting for about 5% of all cases
(Claus et al, 1991), Familial early onset breast and
ovarian cancers in some families has been mapped to a
susceptibility gene on the long arm of chromosome 17
(Hall er al, 1990), known as breast cancer 1 gene
{BRCA 1). Genetic analysis of meiotic recombinants in
large Kindreds narrowed down the susceptibility locus
to a region of approximately 1 to 2 mega bases on
Y7qi2-21, flanked by markers DI7S776 and D17S78
(Bowcock et al, 1993). BRCAL was subsequently
cloned (Miki e”’ al, 1994) by applying positional
cloning strategies. Mutational analysis of the gene
showed that the DNA sequence was altered in family
members with long linkage to I7q markers. However,
in three of the cight putative BRCAI kindreds
potential predisposing mutations were not found
(Miki et a, 1994). Mutations in BRCAL have now
been confirmed in several additional families (Castiia
et al, 1994; Friedman et al., 1994; Simard et al, 1994),

Sporadic cases of breast cancer also involve genetic
alterations at various chromosomal loci including
regions of 17g, The BRCAI region displays LOH in
30-70% of sporadic breast and ovarian cancers
(Euiceal et a, 1992; Jacobs et al., 1993; Cropp et al.,
1994). Futreai er al. (19942,b) performed an extensive
mutational analysis of the BRCAI coding region in
primary breast and ovarian tumors which showed
allelic loss at chromosome 17421. Surprisingly only
four of the 44 tumors studied were found to contain &
mutation and in all cases the mutations were shown to
bbe germline. On the basis of these results they
suggested that there could be a fundamental difference
between the origin or sporadic tumors and those in
genetically predisposed BRCA1 carriers. The low
frequency of somatic mutations in sporadic cases
raised some suspicion as to the role of BRCA\ in the
great majority of breast cancers and suggested the
possiblity of yet another suppressor gene within the
17q21 region, but outside the BRCAI locus (Vogelstein
and Kinzler, 1994). These recent findings underscore
the need to search for the presence of other tumor
susceptibility genes within this chromosomal region

Several methods are currently available for isolating
expressed sequences from genomic regions. Of these
methods cDNA selection (Lovett et al., 1991; Parimoo
et al,, 1991) is one of the most direct and least
ambiguous, It involves the immobilization of target
DNAS, isolated from YAC, phage or cosmid clones, on
‘a solid support and hybridixation with a pool of
eDNAS followed by PCR amplification of the hybrid.
selected material. Other method such as exon trapping
(Buckler er al., 1991), HTF islfind rescue (Patel et al.
1991) and sequence conservation (Sulston et al, 1992)
have been successfully used for isolating gene
fragments. In the present study, which was underway
at the time of BRCAL cloning, we have analysed the
region proximal to and flanking the BRCAI locus for
transcribed sequences using direct cDNA selection with
a pool of short fragment cDNA libraries from adult
brain, adult testis, etal brain, spleen, thymus and total
fetus. Four overlapping YACs spanning a total of
approximately 470 kb of genomic DNA were used as
target to isolate more than 38 cDNA fragments. Our
results indicate 16 of these cDNAs to encode fragments
of novel genes, some of which are differentially
expressed in various tissues.
