Calf forebrain homogenates contain 2.8 pM muscarinic
acetylcholine receptors per mg of protela. PHJAntagonist
saturation binding experiments under equilibrium conditions
revealed a single class of sites with equilibrium dissoctation
Constants of 0.82 nM for [H}dexetimide and 0.095 nM for
CHquinucliding! benzilate, Displacement binding studies
with agonists revealed the presence of fow and high affinity
sites. Here we describe the solubilization of muscarinic acetyl-
choline receptors with digitonin and their purification by
affinity chromatography using an affinity gel which consisted
Of dexetimide coupled to AfF-Gel 10 (j.e., carboxy N-hyd-
roxysuccinimide esters linked via a 1mm spacer arm {0
agarose beads). Purified proteins were obtained by specie
elution with muscarinie drugs, ie., the antagonist atropine
‘and. the irreversible ligand propylbenzilylcholine mustard.
‘SDS-polyacrslamide gel electrophoresis of the radioiodinated
purified preparations revealed a major 70-K protein.

Introduction

‘The neurotransmitter acetylcholine elicits rapid responses
by interacting with nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) and slower
effects via muscarinic receptors (mACHRs). Muscarinic
responses are observed in the central and peripheral nervous,
system as well as in muscle and in glands and representa large
Proportion of the acetylcholine-mediated effects, Due to the
extraordinarily high number of nAChRs found in the post
synaptic membrane of the electromotor synapses of electric
fish, knowledge of the mechanism and structure of nACHRS.
hhas increased tremendously in recent years (Changeux, 1981).
‘Advances in research on mACHRs have been much less rapid.
This is due to the lower concentration of mACARS, together
with the fact that these receptors have not yet been purified.

Earlier radioligand binding studies revealed that mACHRS
are discrete membrane components which recognize an-
tagonist and agonist molecules (Gorissen et al, 1978; Birdsall,
et al., 1979; Haga, 1980). As is the case with many other
receptor systems, the two types of ligands appear to differ in
their mechanisms of interaction in the following way: only
agonists induce receptor desensitization in intact cell prepara-
tions (Klein et al., 1979; Simon and Klein, 1979); the recep
tors are composed of different subpopulations with the same
affinity for antagonists but different affinities for agonists
(Birdsall e¢ al, 1978; Ehlert et a., 1981); guanine nucleotides

and Mg?* ions have opposite effects on agonist affinity but
‘no effect on antagonist binding (Ehlert er ai., 1981; Wei and
Sulakhe, 1980; Sokolovsky et ai., 1980); and finally, agonists
but not antagonists induce conformational changes in the
receptors (Vauquelin et al, 1982).

'mACARS have been successfully solubilized with a wide
variety of detergents, of which digitonin appears to be the
‘most effective (Gorissen et al., 1981; Ruess and Lieflander,
1979; Hurko, 1978; Aaronstam etal, 1978; Repke and Mat
thies, 1980). ‘An affinity gel with high affinity for mACHRS
(Repke et al, 1980) has been described recently and a
Durifcation of hydrophobic MACHR and nACHR proteins
‘was attempted earlier (Barrantes ef al, 1975). We report here
the first successful purification of mACHRS, These receptors
were solubilized with digitonin, purified by absorption on an
affinity get with dexetimide followed by selective elution with
the MACHR antagonist atropine or with the highly specific
Inreversible ligand propylbenzilyicholine mustard (PrBCM).
‘The radioiodinated purified proteins were analysed by SDS-
polyacrytamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE),
