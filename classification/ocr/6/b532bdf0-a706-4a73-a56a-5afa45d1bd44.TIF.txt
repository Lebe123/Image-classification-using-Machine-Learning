Abstract

{Ina 12-month inhalation study on rats using room-aged sidestream smoke (RASS, 12 1g total particulate matier
(TPM) as an experimental surrogate for environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), we investigated differentiation
‘changes, ie. altered cytokeratin (CK) expression, in the epithelial lining at nasal cavity level | (NLU) (anterior portion
of nasal cavity), and their correlation with histomorphological changes. In addition to conventional histopathological
‘examination, routine parafin sections were immunohistologically stained for various rat CK and evaluated. Changes
in CK expression were observed in the nonciliated respiratory epithelium of masilloturbinate, lateral wall, and
rnasoturbinate: in basal eels, increase of CKI4 and CKI8 and decrease of CK1S, in nonciliated columnar cells
increase of CKIS and CKI9, These CK changes had histomorphological correlates, ie, reserve cell hyperplasia an
squamous metaplasia. CK expression changes were also seen at sites without histomorphological changes, ©
enhanced expression of CK14, CK in ciliated cells at the dorsal meatus, and CKIS at the septum. Most of the CK
‘expression changes seen after 1 year of RASS exposure resembled the changes previously seen after 8 days of
exposure, © 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserve.
