ATPase wctivities were measured in surface membranes and mitochondria isolated from promastigotes
of the parasitic protozoan Leishmania donovani. The 0wo enzymes were differehtiated on the basis of pH
‘optima, inhibitor sensitivity and by immunochemical methods. The surface-membrane (SM-) ATPase had
aan activity of 100 nmol/min per mg of protein, which was optimal at pH 6.5. The enzyme was Mg-
‘dependent, partially inhibited by Ca®*, and unaffected by Na* or K. The SM-ATPase was inhibited by
orthovanadate, NN'-dicyclohexylearbodi-imidc, and N-ethylmaleimide (IC,, (concentration causing half-
‘maximal inkibition) 7.5, 25 and 520 jst respectively}; however, it was unaffected by ouabain, azide or
oligomycin. The SM-ATPase demonstrated a K,, of 1.05 mw and a V_,,, of 225 nmol/min per mg of protein.
Moreover, fine-structure cytochemical results demonstrated that the SM-ATPase was localized to the
cytoplasmic lamina of the parasite SM. A method was devised for the isolation of SM-derived vesicles, These
were used to demonstrate the proton-pumping capacity of the SM-ATPuse, Cumulatively, these results

constitute the first demonstration of a surface-m

INTRODUCTION

Species of the parasitic protozoan Leishmania are the
causative agents of a wide variety of human cutaneous,
mucocutaneous and visceral diseases. These organisms
have a digenetic life cycle in which both developmental
slages reside in hydrolytic environments, i., as extra-
cellular agellated promastigote forms within the alimen-
tary tract of their sandfly vector and as obligate
intracellular amastigote forms within secondary Iyso-
somes of human macrophages (Chang & Dwyer. 1978
Berman et aly 1979; Dwyer, 1979; Tim et al, 1980;
Bordice etal, 1982),

Previously we demonstrated that L. donovani pro-
rastigotes possess active transport systems which are
protonmotive-force (pml -driven (Zilberstein & Dwyer,
1985), ic., a proton clecirochemical gradient is created
across the parasite surface membrane (SM) which is
coupled to transport systems by maintaining symport
translocation of specific substrates with protons. Such
plasma-membrane activities have been deseribed in
bacteria (Zilberstein et al., 1979; Kaback, 1983) and
fungi (Eddy & Nowacki, 1971; Goffeau & Slayman,
1981; Perlin et al, 1984) as well as in membranes of
various cel organelies (Oshumi & Anraku, 1981 ; Fishkes
& Rudnick, 1982; Reeves, 1983),

Ina variety of cells and organelles, membrane-bound
proton-translocating ATPases (H"
demonstrated to be energy transducers whieh utilize the
energy of ATP hydrolysis to generate a proton electro-
chemical gradient (Gotfeau & Slayman, 1981 ; Oshumi &
Anraku, 1981; DuPont e7 ai., 1982; Galloway er al.,

Carafoli, 1987). As’ pm drives energy-transduction
processes cross the leishmanial SM_(Zilberstein &
Dwyer, 1985), it was anticipated that an H*-ATPase
acting asa primary proton pump should be present in the
plasma membrane of this organism. Previously, it was
suggested that the leishmanial SM_ might contain an
ATPase (Dwyer & Gottlieb, 1983). In the present study
we have identified and characterized a vanadate-sensitive
Mgt'-dependent ATPase activity in isolaied SMs of
L. donovani promastigotes and demonstrated that this
enzyme is a proton pump.

Part of this work has already been presented in
abstract form (Zilbersicin & Dwyer, 1987),
