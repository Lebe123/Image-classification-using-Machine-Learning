AMONG the many neurochemical abnormalities demonstrated to
‘occur inthe postmortem beans of Alzheimer’s patents is a loss
‘of cholinergic nicotinic receptor density (HI. 18, 21, 26). This
loss parallels a deficit in other cholinergic markers and is consis
tent with the functional impairment observed prior to death
While itis generally recognized thatthe brain muscarinic recep-
tor system plays an imponnt role in learning and memory, less
is known about the role of te aicotnie system. In humans, nic-
‘tine is Known to not only imrewe the attentional component of
information processing in Yearning (acquisition) but also facili-
lates the input of anformation to storage (retention) in the mens
or process (24), Additionally. selective blockade of cent nico-
timc receptors has heen eeponed (0 produce memory ammpit-
ment in rodent animal models (1.4, 9. 13, 17), and t Slow cog

ceptors associated with Alzheimers disease may underlie, at least

‘The nervous system and behavioral repertoire of old world
‘monkeys resembles the human newrobehavioral system more that
any other laboratory animal. except higher apes. In addition,
spontaneous and conditioned behavior exhibited bythe monkey is
‘more similar to tht of the human than any other laboratory ani
‘mal (19). Therefore, behavioral tasks which tap the higher cog-
nitive abilities of these nontuman primates (16) may provide
Infomation relevant t0 normal himan aging snd to the demien-
bias, The method most frequently employed to test the sophisti
cated cognitive repertoire of these monkeys has been one oF
another variation of the delayed response task. The delayed
‘matching-o-samiple (DMTS) task allows the measurement of abil-
ites which are relevant ro human aging such as attention, sat
egy formation, weaction time in complex situations and memory
