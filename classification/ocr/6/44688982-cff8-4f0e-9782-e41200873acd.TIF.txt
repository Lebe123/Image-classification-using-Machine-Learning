Radiofrequency itradiation of the N-methyl zroup in nicotine st pD values of 11.0,5.0, and 08 caused nuclear
Overhauser enhancersen's (NOE) of the pyridyl protons and the C-2’ and C-5" protons on the pyrrolidine ring.
However, irradiation of the N-methyl group at 2.13 ppm of nicotine in trifluoroacetic acid solution (TFA) did not
cause an NOE on the pyridyl protons but rater on the C.2" and C-8'9 protons. In TFA, the ate of deprotona

(of nicotinium diacid salts is slow compared to the NMR time scale, and the peak at 3.13 ppm is attributed tothe
ricotinivi salt a whieh the N-methyl group is trans to the pyridine ring. A second singlet at 282 pom isatteibuted
to the nicotinium salt in which the V-methyl group is cia ta the pyridine cing, These assignments were established
bby NMR studies in mistures of TFA-TF A-d, These resulta are interpreted in term of nizeogen protonationdepro-
tonation-pyramidal inversion equilibria and the complexities of NOE studies on configurationally mobile systems.
‘The rates of inversion and proton relaxation are considered. It is estimated that nicotine-eee base exists with its
‘Nemethyl group preferentially (90.9 + 0.9%) trans to the pyridine ring by gas-phase kinetic quenching experiments,

   

 

‘The configuration! of nicotine and nicotine acid salts has
been a topic of concern for many years." Nicotine structural
analysis indicates two unknown features: the orientation of
the N-methyl group and the relative position of the pyridine
and pyrrolidine rings. Experimental determination of these
two structural parameters is complicated by the likelihood of
ow enerzy barriers to change." We now report the cesults of
‘our studies which show that the preferred (>30%) conti
ration of the N-methyl group in nicotine is 1” (R) (ie, trans
to the pyridine ring) under a variety of experimental condi-
tions.

Recently, Chynoweth, Ternai, Simeral, and MacielS con-
cluded on the basis of their NMR studies of nicatine in CDCly
land Ds0 “that the N-mathyl group is preferentially on the
‘same side of the pyrrolidine ring a8 the pyridine ring”. That
conclusion’ contrasted with perturbative configuration in-
teraction calculations performed by Pullman, Courriere, and

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

Coubeils,7* which indicated that 1 (see Scheme I) was ap,
proximately 4 kcal/mol more stable than 2.1! Other investi
gators? based their configurational assignments on (1) steric
evaluations using space-filling models or (2) demethylation
studies of nicotine N’-oxide. Any conclusion based on these
latter two criteria meets with severe criticism. Finally, Koo
and Kira® have roported the x-ray analysis ofa crystal of ni=
‘cotine dihydriodide in which the N-methyl group was in a
trana configuration with respect to the pyridine ring (ef. 3).
However, the crystalline sample was undoubtedly prepared
under conditions in which the equilibria shown in Scheme I
were operative, and itis theoretically possible that a minor
component, or one of a number of components, crystallized.
In addition, conclusions based on x-ray data of a solid cannot
necessarily be applied to the conformation or configuration,
of the same molecule in solution, especially if protonation
deprotonation reactions are occurring in solution.'*
