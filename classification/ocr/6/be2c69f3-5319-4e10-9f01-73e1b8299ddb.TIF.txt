Localization of Muscarinic Receptor mRNAs in
Rat Heart and Intrinsic Cardiac Ganglia by
In Situ Hybridization

Donald B. Hoover, Ronald H. Baisden, Sylvia X. Xi-Moy

Abstract Although the heart is considered relatively pure
source of m2 muscarinic receptors, the posible expression of
‘other muscarinic receplor genes at diserete sites within the
myocardium of by intrinsic cardiac ganglia had not been
‘valued. Accordingly, the resent sudy used in sit hybrid
ization histochemistry with *Sslabeled oligonucleotide probes
to address this issu, Initial experiments demonstrated thatthe
localization of m2 mRNA was similar to that reported for
muscarinic receptors labeled withthe nonselective muscarinic
antagonist guinuelidiny! benaiate; however, there were two
important exceptions. The condvcting system contained less
message than expected, whereas the intrinsic cardiac ganglia
contained more. The mismatch between muscarinic recepior
‘and m2 mRNA densities in the conducting system could not be
‘explained by the local expression of other muscarinic receptor
genes, since mi, m3, and m4 mRNAs were not detected at this

 

 

uscarinic receptors located at a diversity of

sites are known to contribute to the neuro-

regulation of cardiac fonction. Postjune~
tional cholinergic receptors on the myocardium have
‘been most thoroughly studied and can directly elicit
negative chronotropic, dromotropic, or inotropic re-
sponses when uctivated by muscarinic agonists or the
stimulation of cholinergic nerves.!> Muscarinic recep-
tors are also associated with cholinergic and adrenergic
nerves in the heart.'** These prejunctional receptors
have an inhibitory influence on the release of acetyl-
choline and norepinephrine and presumably have a role
in fine-tuning the amount of neurotransmitter available
to interact with postjunctional receptors. Last, musca-
rinic receptors are present on efferent neurons of the
cardiac ganglia, where they may have a role in modu-
lating ganglionic neurotransmission."""?

‘An additional level of complexity has been added by
the discovery of multiple muscarinic receptor subtypes.
Five muscarinic receptor genes have been identified in
molecular cloning experiments, and the corresponding
receptor proteins have been designated ml through
m5.!\* Heterogeneity of muscarinic receptors has also
been documented in functional and radioligand binding,
experiments with muscarinic antagonists, Although the

the mammalian heart.°!7.8 However, the evaluation,
‘of muscarinic receptor mRNAs in the heart has been
limited to the atrium, which is also the region of heart
that has been most frequently used in functional and.
radioligand binding studies of muscarinic receptor sub-
types. Accordingly, it is still possible that other
muscarinic receptor genes might be expressed at dis-
crete sites within the myocardium.

‘The distribution of muscarinic receptors in rat heart
was evaluated in a previous study by in vitro receptor
autoradiography with ['HJquinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB)
a nonselective muscarinic antagonist.” These exper
‘ments revealed a regional variation in the density of
‘muscarinic receptors within the heart, with levels being
highest in the atria, sinoatrial (SA) node, atrioventrie
ular (AV) node, bundle of His, and intrinsic cardiac
ganglia. The present study was initiated to evaluate the
localization of m2 mRNA in rat heart by in situ hybrid-
ization histochemistry and to determine the extent t0
Which the distribution and abundance of message for
this receptor subtype correspond to that of muscarinic
receprors. These experiments demonstrated that th
conducting system contained less m2 mRNA than
expected on the basis of its known high density of
muscarinic receptors. Accordingly, additional experi-
ments were done to determine whether other musca~
