‘Background. Data continue to accumulate supporting a proatherogenic role for oxidized low-density
lipoprotein (Ox-LDI). Antioxidant micronutrients such as ascorbate, cctocopherol, and beta carotene,
levels of which can be favorably manipulated hy dietary measures without side effects, could be a safe
approach in inhibiting LDL oxidation. In fact, in vitro studies have shown that all three antioxidants can
inhibit LDL oxidation. The present study was undertaken to ascertain both the safety and antioxidant
effect of combined supplementation with a-tocopherol, ascorbate, and beta carotene on LDL oxidation.

‘Methods and Resuls. The effect of combined. supplementation with axtocopherol (800 TU/a) plus
ascorbate (1.0 g/d) and beta carotene (30 mg/d) on copper-catalyzed LDL oxidation was tested in a
randomized, placebo-controlled study in two groups of 12 male subjects over a 3-month period. Blood
samples forthe lipoprotein profile, antioxidant levels, and LDL isolation were obtained at baseline and
at 3 months. Nether placebo nor combined antioxidant therapy resulted in any side effects or exerted an
Adverse effect on the plasma lipoprotein profil. Compared with placebo, combined antioxidant therapy
resulted in a significant increase in plasma ascorbate and lipid standardized a-tocopherol and beta
carotene levels (2.6, 41-, and 16.3-fold respectively). At baseline, there were no significant differences in
the time course curves and kinetics of LDL oxidation as evidenced by the thiobarbituric acid reacting
substances (TBARS) assay and the formation of conjugated dienes. However, at 3 months, combined
supplementation resulted in a twofold prolongation ofthe lag phase and a 40% decrease in the oxidation
rate, The combined antioxidant group was also compared with a group that received 800 TU of
‘tocopherol only. Although the combined antioxidant group had significantly higher ascorbate and bet
carotene levels than the group supplemented with a-tocopherol alone, there were no significant
differences between the two groups with respect to LDL oxidation kinetics.

‘Conclusions. Combined supplementation with ascorbate beta carotene, and a-tocopherol is not superior
to high-dose a-tocopherol alone in inhibiting LDL oxidation. Hence, a-tocopherol therapy should be
favored in future coronary prevention trials involving antioxidants. (Circulation. 1993;88:2780 2786.)

here is a growing body of data to support the

‘concepts that oxidatively modified low-density

lipoprotein (LDL) is proatherogenic!* and exists
in vivo ** Additional support for this concept comes from
the finding that antioxidant supplementation will inhibit
the progression of atherosclerosis in animal models.*?? A
clinical trial with antioxidants in humans is crucial in
validating the oxidized LDL hypothesis. However, most of
the antioxidants tested in animal models to date are
chemical compounds— probucol, butylated hydroxytolu-
ene (BHT), and diphenylphenylenediamine (DPD) —
and they carry potential side effects; therefore, their utility
for prevention of atherosclerosis in humans is probably
limited. On the other hané, the dietary micronutrients
with antioxidant properties ~ascorbate, a-tocopherol, and
beta carotene—may provide an alternate approach to

protection of LDL against oxidative modification and
hence, prevention of atherosclerosis. Previous invest
gations” have shown that these antioxidant micronute-
tents can inhibit LDL oxidation when added in vitro. Also,
supplementation of the diet with a-tocopherol or ascor-
bate has been reported to decrease susceptibility of LDL
to otidation.®* Whether these effects are additive when
ven in combined supplementation, however, has not
been determined in depth. Recently, a report appeared
using high doses of combined antioxidant supplementa-
tion and using a nonrandomized, sequential design. In this,
report, the authors failed to show an added benefit on
LDL oxidation of combined ascorbate, beta carotene, and
vitamin E to high-dose vitamin E alone The present
study was carried out to ascertain both the safety and
antioxidant effect of combined supplementation with at0-
copherol, ascorbate, and beta carotene on LDL oxidation,
as assessed in a randomized, placebo-controlled study.
