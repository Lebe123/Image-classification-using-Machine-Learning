‘Summary: There is increasing interest in the role of poly
morphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes in the evolution of fo-
‘cal cerebral infarction. Surgical preparation of focal ee
rebral ischemia models may alter leukocyte reactivity and
thereby make interpretation of leukocyte function follow-
ing ischemia/repertusion difficult. The effects of surgical
preparation and of experimental ischemia/teperfusion 00
Branulocyte function have been examined prospectively
ina baboon model. Twenty-six adolescent male baboons
‘underwent surgical preparation, of which 21 underwent
middle cerebral artery occlusionireperfusion. Four addi-

al animals served a8 nonsurgical controls. Peripheral
venous blood specimens were taken for performing as-
says of leukocyte function at defined intervals before and
after both the surgical preparation (i.e., the overall pro-
cedure for implantation of the middle cerebral artery oc-
clusion device) and occlusion/reperfusion. A stress-
‘elated elevation in total eukocyte number was attributed
mainly fo an increase in the number of circulating PMN
Teukoeytes. Values rose from 13.9 = 4.9 x 10° t0 27.8 *
5.8 x 10/ul, (28D; n « 21) for total leukocyte number,
with p < 0.001, and from 4.3 = 2.1 x 10° to 15.9 = 4.7 x
10% (n = 21) for PMN leukocytes, with p < 0.001.

 

 

 

Surgical preparation had no effect (p > 0.4) on the ability
of PMN leukocytes, isolated 24 b after the implantation
procedure, to display polarization, O,"~ production, or
Brelucuronidase release when stimulated with human
(5a. A moderate decrease in the chemotactic response (0
(CSa resolved within the 7-day postsurgery (preocclusion)
period. Three-hour middle cerebral artery occlusion and
[-h reperfusion resulted in a significant reduction in CSa-
induced polarization. The preocclusion value of 82 = 9.7
in = 7) was compared with the occlusion/reperfusion
value at $8.8 + 13.7 (n = 6; p < 0.08). A moderate de-
‘erease was observed in CSa-induced O,~ and Brgluc-
uronidase release, as well as a decrease in the chemotac~
tie response. In the nonhuman primate model, the revers-
ible alterations (i.e., chemotaxis) in granulocyte function
that were noted following surgical preparation resolved
within 7 days. In contrast, middle cerebral artery occlu
sion/reperfusion was associated with a more dramatic and
significant reduction in multiple granulocyte functions
licited by the endogenous mediator C5a as observed 1h
postreperfusion. Key Words: Baboon—Chemotaxis—
Focal ischemia—Middle cerebral artery—Polymorpho-
nuclear leukocyte.

 

 

Polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes may play

mal injury (Vasthare et al., 1990), and perhaps clin-
ical outcome during ischemic stroke. While a small
number of clinical studies on patients recently ex-
periencing stroke have indicated associative alter-
ations in leukocyte rheology, (Ernst et al., 1987;
Vernes and Strik, 1988; Grau et al., 1992), up-
regulation of the granulocyte ®,-intergrin CD18
(Grau et al., 1992), and metabolic activation (Grau
et al., 1992), the practical limitations of those stud-
ies prevent a truly prospective investigation. Even
less is known about the status of leukocytes in an-
imal models in which single-vessel ocelasion is per-
formed to induce focal cerebral ischemia.
