ABSTRACT Transcription of the human erythropoietin
(EPO) gene is activated in Hep3B cells exposed to hypoxia.
[Hyporia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is # nuclear factor whose
DNA binding activity induced by hypoula in Hep3B cells, and
HIF-1 binds ata stein the EPO gene enhancer that Is required
{or hypoxic activation of transcription. In this paper, we
demonstrate that HIF-1 DNA binding activity ls also induced by
!hyponia ina variety of mammalian cll lines in which the EPO
iene is not transcribed. The composition of the HIF-1 DNA

the
1 activation appear tobe similar oF Identical
in EPO-producing and noa-EPO-producing cells. Transcrip-
tion of reporter genes containing the EPO gene enhancer is
induced by hypoxia in non-EPO-producing cells and mutations
{hat eliminate HIF-1 binding. eliminate inducibility, These
results provide evidence that HIF-L and lis recogaltion se-
quence are common components of a general mammalian
cellular response to hypoxia.

 

 

 
 

 

 

Calls sense and respond to extracellular and intracellular
stimli (© maintain homeostasis. and hypoxia is one of the
‘most fundamental of all environmental stimuli. A major
physiologic mechanism by which mammals respond to tissue
hypoxia is through stimulation of erythropoiesis resulting in
fan increased blood Oy-carrying capacity. Erythropoietin
(EPO) the primary humoral regulator of mammalian eryth-
Topoiesis. EPO RNA levels increase several hundredfold in
‘rodent liver and kidney in response to hypoxia or anemia (for
review. see refs. 1 and 2). Human EPO RNA levels show
‘similar increases in transgenic mouse liver and kidney (3-6).
Hypoxia also induces EPO RNA transcription in Hep3B
‘human hepatoblastoma cells (7), demonstrating thatthe same
cell type can sense hypoxia and respond by increasing EPO
RNA levels. The production of EPO and subsequent increase
in erythropoiesis thus provide a major homeostatic mecha
nism for maintaining issue oxygenation.

‘A major research objective in our laboratory has been to
identify the cis-acting DNA sequences and trans-acting pro-
tein factors that regulate hypoxia-inducible human EPO gene
expression. Liver-specific DNase -hypersensitive sites have
been identified in the human EPO gene 3'-flanking sequence
(8). In addition, a 256-nt fragment that encompasses the
hypersensitive sites functioned as a hypoxia-inducible en-
hhancer when cloned 3 toa simian virus 40 (SV40) promoter
chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene and
transiently expressed in Hep3B cells (8). Deletion and scan-
‘ing-mutagenesis studies further delimited the enhancer to 8
S0-nt sequence that was functionally tripartite: site l(t 4=12)
and site 2 (nt 19-23) were absolutely required for hypoxic
induction. whereas site 3 (nt 26-48), a putative thyroid/
steroid hormone receptor binding site, functioned to amplify
the induction signal (9). We identified (9) in Hep3B nuclear
extracts hypoxia-indueible factor 1 (HIF-1), a DNA binding

activity induced by hypoxia that binds specifically to the
enhancer site 1 sequence but not to a mutant sequence
containing a 3-nt substitution that eliminated enhancer func-
tion in transient expression assays. The HIF-1 binding site,
as established by transient expression and electrophoretic.
‘mobility-shift assays (EMSAs) (9) is completely conserved
in the enhancer of the mouse EPO gene (10). Treatment of
Hep3B cells with cycloheximide inhibited the hypoxic induc-
tion of both EPO RNA (7) and HIF-1 DNA binding acuvity
(9), These results provided further evidence for the impor-
{ance of HIF-1 in EPO gene transcriptional activation by
hypoxia and suggested that induction of HIF-1 activity
‘quires de novo protein synthesis.

‘A growing number of other mammalian genes have been
Feported whose expression is induced by hypoxia (11-15).
‘The molecular basis for induction has not been established
for any of these genes, although induction of vascular endo-
thelial growth factor RNA is inhibited by cycloheximide (14).
To determine whether HIF-1 plays a general role in the
hypoxic activation of gene transcription, we have analyzed
‘mammalian cell ines in which the EPO gene is nat expressed.
HIF-1 was induced by hypoxia in all cell lines tested,
including human 293 embryonic kidney and HeLa cervieal
carcinoma cells, mouse Ltk~ fibroblasts, and C:Cy skeletal
‘myoblasts, Ratl fibroblasts, and Chinese hamster ovary
(CHO) cells. The physiological relevance of HIF-1 induction
was supported by our demonstration that the hypoxia-
inducible enhancer was functional in CHO and 293 eels,
whereas the 3-nt mutation that eliminated HIF-1 binding
rendered the enhancer noninducible. These results implicate
HIF-Lin the transcriptional regulation of gene expression by
hypoxia in a variety of mammalian cell types.

 

 

 

 

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell Culture and Nuclear Extract Preparation, Hep3B and
HeLa cells were maintained in minimal essential medium
with Barle’s salts, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine,
‘and 1 mM nonessential amino acids. 293, Ratl, C3Ci, and
LLtk- cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium. CHO cells were grown in a-modified minimum
essential medium. Media were supplemented with 10% (vol/
vol) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, $0 x 10-) unit of
Penicillin per ml. and SO yg of streptomycin per ml (all
purchased from GIBCO). Hypoxia was induced by placing
ells ina modular incubator chamber flushed with 196 03/59
CO,/balance Ns for 4 h at 37°C. When used, cycloheximide
(Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 100M.
