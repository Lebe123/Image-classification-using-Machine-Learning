‘Smoking bebaviour in Germany 1968-1977

‘When we started our work concerned with smoking behaviour, in 1968. we had
eatured into new territory. The only known factors were some results (rom
buervaions and putf profile recordings of smokers (Keith and Hackney. 1962)
which may have influenced machine smoking conditions.

'At about the same time measurements and observations were made to determine
differences ln smoke deliveries between free smoking’ or natural smoking, and
‘restrleted smoking’ or machine smoking. Additionally ideas were put forward
to estimate smoke intake by analysing the amount of smoke cetained in the
tobacco butt and on the fter tip.

‘There were also first thoughts and proposals for the reproduction of hurman
smoking by means ofa ‘slavemoker’ or “puff duplicator,

‘Our ideas stemmed from the observation that the range of human smoking
behaviour i very wide and we would have to study many subjects. Experimental
imethods should be chosen or developed which would allow us to drew conclusions
about the behaviour of the average smoker.

(Of all methods availabe, we thought that the examination of cigarette butts
discarded by smokers would be most successful. This was the only totally non
invasive way fo estimate the amounts of smoke taken by human smokers, and tuch
‘cigarette butts are available in large enough samples to answer many questions.
‘The butt analysis KIPA’ (Crom Kippen.a slang term for cigarette end) is limited
to filter cigarettes. which formed approximately 85% of the cigarette consumption
in Germany.

‘The basis of KIPA isthe correlation ofthe amount of smoke retained in the
filter with the actual amount of smoke taken in by the smoker. Under constant
‘smoking conditions (puff volume and puff duration, whichis equivalent to constant
flow rate) the ratio between the amount of smoke retained in the fer and the
factual intake of smoke is constant. One can therefore calculate the amount of
trmoke taken by the smoker from the amount of smoke retained by the titer,
LUnforvunately. this is nt the case in aatural smoking. Smoking conditions are
‘ot constant, and the ratio ofthe smoke retained by the filter and the amount of
smoke taken by the smoker is not necessarily constant,

‘Additional information about smoking behaviour and knowiedge about the
dependance of ftration coeicients (for individual smoke components) on smoking
‘Jonditions are therefire necessary. Only zhen can the actual intake of smoke be
