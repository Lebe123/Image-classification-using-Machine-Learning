ABSTRACT A homology-based cDNA cloning approach
‘was used to identify a widely expressed protein-tyrosine kinase
designated as “focal adhesion kinase” (FadK). The entire
rouse FadK amino acid sequence was deduced from cDNA.
clones, revealing a large (119-kDa) non-membrane-spanning
protein-tyrosine kinase that lacks Sre-homology SH2 and SH3
domains. Immunostaining of BALB /e 3T3 fibroblasts revealed
that FadK is concentrated in focal adhesions. FadK is phos-
phorylated on tyrosine in growing cultures of BALB/c 3T3
cells but contains litte or no phosphotyrosine in cells detached
by trypsinization. The tyrosine-phosphorylated state is re-
sgained within minutes when the cells are replated onto fibro-
nectia. Activation of FadK may be an important early step in
intracelolar signal transduction pathways triggered in re-
sponse to cell interactions with the extracellular matrix.

‘The metazoan proteinyrosine kinases (PTKs) make up a
large segment of the eukaryotic protein kinase superfamily (1,
2)and are known for their oncogenic potential as well as their
roles in regulating aspects of normal development (reviewed
in refs. 3-$), PTKs are grouped into two broad structural
classes on the basis of whether or not they span the plasma
‘membrane. Membrane-spanning PTKs include receptors for
various peptide growth and differentiation factors such as
epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor,
Receptor PTK activity is stimulated upon ligand binding, and
subsequent receptor autophosphorylation followed by phos-
phorylation of exogenous substrates is an initial event in the
signal transduction pathway (reviewed in refs. Sand6). PTKs
that do not span the plasma membrane (ie., members of the
Sre subfamily) have also been implicated in the transduction
of extracellular signals that control cell growth and differen-
tiation (reviewed in refs. 7-9)

Given what is known about the widespread involvement of
PTKs in regulating developmental processes, we sought t0
identify and characterize PTKs, with the ultimate goal of
obtaining insight into how cells respond to environmental
cues that influence their growth and differentiation. In this
feport, we describe a non-membrane-spanning PT identi-
fied by alhomology-based DNA cloning strategy and present
evidence that its activation may be part of a signal transduc~
tion pathway triggered in response to cellular interactions
with components of the extracellular matrix (ECM).

annealing, 2 min at SO°C; extension. 3 min at 72°C: denatur-
ation, 0.5 min at 94°C. Amplified CDNA products of ~210
base pairs were subcloned and nucleotide sequences were
‘determined for 200 inserts picked at random.

Isolation of CDNA Clones Encoding Mouse FadK and North-
erm Analysis of Expression. The PCR product TK3 was used
as a probe to screen (10) a mouse 8.Sday embryo CDNA
library (11) constructed in Agt10. To obtain clones represen:
tative of the entire =4.Sckilobase (kb) transcript, it was
necessary to resereen the library with probes derived from
the 5” and 3" ends of the initial eDNA isolates. Nucleotide
sequences were determined, from both complementary
strands, for four overlapping clones to obtain the composite
sequence shown.

RNA isolation and Northern hybridization were done as
described (12). The blots were hybridized with a probe
derived from a BamHll~Ace I fragment (nucleotides 3476—
4084) in the 3° untranslated region of the FadK cDNA.

Production of Antiserum to FadK and Antibody Affinity
Purification. Anti-FadK antiserum was obtained from New
Zealand White rabbits immunized with a bacterially ex:
pressed fusion protein consisting of the C-terminal 150 amino
acid residues of mouse FadK. lying downstream of 16 vector-
derived residues from the p17-7 plasmid vector (13). Ant
bodies from the immune serum were affinity-purified (14)
against the fusion protein blotted to Inymobilon membrane
(Milipore).

Immunoprecipitation of FadK, Immune-Complex Kinase
Assay, and Phospho Amino Acid Analysis. BALB/c 3T3
mouse fibroblasts (from W. J. Pledger. Vanderbilt Univer:
sity) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's me-
dium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum. Cellular
proteins were metabolically labeled with [/*S]methionine/
‘cysteine by incubating the cells for 16 hr at 37°C in methio-
ninesfree DMEM containing 5% complete DMEM, 4% calf
serum, and Tran?S-label (1000 Ci/mmol; ICN; 1'Ci = 37
GBq) at 100 uCi/ml. Phosphoproteins were labeled by ineu-
Dating the cells for § hr at 37°C in phosphate-free medium
containing 4% calf serum and ["Plorthophosphate (9000
Cifmmol; NEN) at 1.5 mCi/ml. Cells were lysed in RIPA
buffer (SO mM Tris Cl, pH 74/150 mM NaCl/S mM
EDTA/1% Nonidet P-40/1% sodium deoxycholate/0.1%
SDS/1% aprotinin, 50. mM NaF/0.1 mM NasVO.) and inv
munoprecipitation of FadK was achieved by mixing 2 yl of
antiserum with 1 mi of clarified lysate, incubating on ice for
15 br, and then adding 50 gl of a $0% slurry of protein
