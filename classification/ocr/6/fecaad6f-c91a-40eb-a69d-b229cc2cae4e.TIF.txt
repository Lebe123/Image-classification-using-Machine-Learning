Introduction

 

‘There is a great need for the analysis and quantitation of
Neniteosamines, because they have been shown to be
Caveinogenie (ce review [1D They are widely distributed in
‘water, tir, sol, foods and chemical products, and are also
‘casily formed from various nitrogen containing precursors,
“There i also a need forthe analysis of alkyl niteites, the O-
nitroso compounds, because they are often abused for sexual
excitement and can eause death. Alkyl nitrites, such as
iSoamyl nitrite and ethyl nitrite, are normally used for the
therapy of coronary insufficiency.

‘Although number of papers have been published on
the analyses of Nenitrosamines by postive electron impact

(Eb, mass spectrometry (MS) [2~6}, negative chemical
fonization (Cl) spectra of nitroso compounds have so far
rot been reported. We have recently introduced CO, ws
Feagent gas for negative CT MS [7] and found it very belpfUl
bbut information on the reaction mechanisms of CO; in
negative ionization is sil lacking. Ij the present paper,
therefore, we present the negative Cl mass spectra of seven
[Nenitrosimings and five alkyl nitrites with CO, as reagent
gat, The mechanisms of addition product formation were
Studied using two different isotopically labeled CO,

 

Experimental

N-Nitrosodimethylamine, N-nitrosodiethylamine, N-nitro-
sodipropylamine, N-nitroso-N-methyTbutylamine. N-nitro-
So-Nethylbutylamine and Nenitrosopiperidine were ob-
ined from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO; Nenitro-
opyrrolidine and t-butyl aitete from Fluka AG, Buchs,
Switzerland; and ethyl itsite, ®-buty trite, n-penty nitrite
and soamy/ nitrite from Merck, Darmstadt, West Germany.
Carbon-!C-dioxide and carbon dioxide-'"0, were
purchased from Merck Sharp and Dohme Canada Limited,
Montreal, Canada. 0.2% Carbowax 1500 on 80/100
Carbopak C was obtained from Supelco, Ine. Bellefoate,
PA

'N-Nitcosamines were dissolved in distilled water and I yl
of the sample containing 15 jg ofthe amines was injected
into the port ofthe yas chromatograph (GC). The headspace
‘method was adopted forthe analyses of alkyl nitrites; 0.5
TO of the vapor was injected for each analysis.

The instrument used was an LKB 2091 GC-MS com-
bination unit, modified for CI MS as described by Ryhage
IB], For the work ia the negative Cl mode, the polarities
fof the magnetic current, accelerating voltage and repeller
Voltage were reversed (9).

‘The GC conditions were: a 1.02.0 mm glass colum:
packed with 0.2% ‘Carbowax 1°300 on 80/100_-mesh
Carbopack C: column temperature 100— 130°C depending.
fon the compound analysed; injection temperature about
30°C higher than the column temperature; and helium flow
rate 10 ml/mia,

‘Negative Ci spectra were recorded at chamber pressure
of about 1x10"! Torr except when C10, was used. Other

tive CI_MS conditions were: accelerating. voltage
SEV; total electron emission $00jA; electron encrsy
250eV; separator. temperature 225°C: and jon source
icmperavure 260°C. Positive El spectra were also run for
‘comparison at 70.6V.
