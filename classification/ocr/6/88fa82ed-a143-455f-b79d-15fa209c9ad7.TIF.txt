‘Summary

Interleukin-4 (IL-4) treatment of 320 cells overexpress-
‘ng insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) causes prompt
tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Transfection of
truncation mutants of the human IL-4 (hull-4) receptor
Into320-IRS-1 cells demonstrated thatthe region from
‘amino acid 437-587 is important for IL-4 signaling.
This region of the IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) contains the
‘motif “"PL-X4-NPXYXSXSO* (Insulin/IL-4R {14RD
{ound in the insulin and insulinike growth factor 1
receptors, Mutation of Y497 to yielded receptors that
‘caused lttle or no IRS-1 phosphorylation in response
tohull-4 when expressed in 32D-IRS-t colle. Most cll
lines expressing Y497F also foiled to proliferate in
response to hull-4, Furthermore, a glutathione-S-
transferase fusion proteln containing the 14A motit~
‘bound IRS-1, tyrosinekinase(s), and other unidentified
phosphoproteins with molecular sizes of 140, 80, and
'55 kd. Thus, the central tyrosine of the I4R motif has
‘4 major role in IL-4-mediated signal transduction In

Introduction

Inteteukin- (IL-4) is a cytokine produced by T cells How-
ard ot al, 1982), mast calls (laut eta, 1989), and baso-
phils (Seder eta, 1991). Among Its diverse array of bic
loge functions (reviewed by Paul, 1991) are the abilty to
Induce or enhance the expression of major histocompat
bilty complex class II molecules (Noolle et al, 1984) and
(6023 00 B cals (Conad et al, 1987), its own receptor
‘onlymphocytes (Ohara and Pavi, 1988), and vascular call
‘adhesion molecule 1 on endothalilcolis(Schieimer et al

11992); the ability to induce the secretion ofimmunoglobu-
lint (vtotaetat., 1988) andimmunoglobuln (Coffman
‘tal, 1986) while diminishing the immunoglobulin secre-
tion of other isotypes: and the ability to act as a growth
factor for B calls, T cells, and mast cals (Lee ota, 1986).

‘This diverse array of IL-¢-mediated effocts i roflectd in
the broad cistibution of IL-4 recoptrs (IL-4Rs). A single
lass of high-atfnty binding sites (K., 20-300 pM) have
‘been detected on a wide varity of hematopoietic andinon-
‘hematopoietic cal types at levels ranging trom 100-5000
sites/cell Ohara and Pau, 1887; Park tal, 1987; Lowen
thal tal, 1988). The molecular cloning of CDNA encoding
‘both the murine IL-4R (mulL-4R) (Mosley etal, 1989; H
ada etal, 1980) and human IL-4R (null-4R) (lazerda et
‘al, 1990; Gazz etal, 1990) andthe expression in COST
‘ols indicated that a single chain of ~ 139,000 daltons
constituted ahigh-affinityIL-4-binding sito, Recently, thas
‘been shown thatthe IL-2R y chain (common ye) i 4880
ciated with IL-4F in the presence of IL-4 (Russel etal,
1993) and that its presence contributes a 2- to 3d in
crease in binding afinty. The IL-4F contains the charac-
teristic pairs of cysteine residues and the WSXWS moti
found in other members of the hematopoiatin receptor su-
perfamily, anit beare one ofthe largest cytoplasmic do-
‘mains, comprised of over 500 amino acids (Cosman, 1983)

Like otner members ofthis receptor family, the IL-4F.
‘doesnot contain any consensus sequences characterise
of tyosine or serinethreonine kinases. However, actva-
tion ofthe IL-4R with IL induces the rapid and striking
tyrosine phosphorylation ofa 170 kd protein (Mora et al.
1988; sfortand no, 1990; Wang eta, 1992), called 4PS,
‘a well as phosphorylation of the recoptor itso (Wang et
al, 1992; luhnaraandHarada, 1993),suggestingalinkage
‘among the IL-4R, 4PS, anda yrosine kinase. Phosphory-
lation of 4S results in its association withthe p85 subunit
‘ofphosphotidylinsite:3kinase P1-3K) andthe subsequent
induction of PIK activity (Wang et a, 1992). Interest-
ingly. it was found that 4°S is antigenically related to a
prominent substrate of tho insulin receptor Kinase, called
Inauinocoptor substrate 1(IRS-1) (Sun etal, 1991; Wang
‘tal, 19982). Addition of insulin or nsulin-ike growth fac-
tor 1 (IGF-1) resulted in the tyrosine phospherylation of
4PS in myeloid col ines. Furthormor
‘2 myeloid cal line transtectec with the CDNA encoding
IRS-* results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and
its subsequent association withthe p85 subunit of PLOK,
‘suggesting thatthe IL-4R and the insulin receptor have
partially overlapping signal transduction pathways and
that IRS-1 and 4PS are functionaly sii

thas recently been shown that IL-4 treatment can lead
te phosphorylation of RS-1 in nonhematopoietic cells
(Pussellatal., 1993). L cells express bothIL-4R andinsuiin
receptor; however, they lack they. Lcslls demonstrated
IRS-1 phosphorylation in response to insulin but not in
response to IL-4. However, stable L ell transfectants that
‘xpress the 7. showed clear IRS-1 phosphoryation in re-
‘sponse to IL-4. These results indicate that IRS-t can be
‘a natural substrate for IL-4-medlated signaling, and they
‘how that the yi8 nt only associated withthe IL-4A but
's essential for certain forms of L-4-meciated signal rans-
duction
