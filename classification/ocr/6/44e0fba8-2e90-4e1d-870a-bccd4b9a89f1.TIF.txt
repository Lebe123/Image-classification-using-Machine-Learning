Reinventing American Tobacco Policy
Sounding the Medical Community's Voice

1998 may be the most important moment inthe history of tho
‘bacco wars, a moment when Ameria chooses between a
path toward socal repair or one toward irrevocable public
lose. Winston Craredil said, “Americans canbe coonted upan
todotherigitthingaftertrying everything else.” This year,
Americar may fly da the rightthing. After yearsufgrow-
ing pubic md professional awareness ofthe adicivencns of
nicotine, ofthe health ofect of tobacco, and of the tobacco
industey’s extensive efforts to target young children, federal
laws may be enacted to seriously weaken tho grip ofthe in-
dustry on the publi and on the nation's health. Convareely,
there is the rigk thatthe tabaceoindastry could farther ene
trench it ability to stand outside the ordinary rules of com-
merce in society.

Th large measure, the outcome depends on tho strength of
tho voice and message from the meteal and public boat
professions. We must ensure that protection ofthe public's
boalthprovalsastheforomeetinsue and becomes he ultimate
decision fore.

By these actions tho tobacco makers have shown them-
