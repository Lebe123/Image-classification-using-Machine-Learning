‘SUMMARY

We have examined the role of FGF signaling during
activin-mediated mesoderm induction in Xenopus. Using
‘dominant inhibitory mutants of FGF signal transducers to
disrupt the FGF-signaling pathway at the plasma
‘membrane or in the cytosol prevents animal eap blas-
tomeres from expressing several mesodermal markers in
response to exogenous activin. Dominant inhibitory
‘mutants of the FGF receptor, e-ras or e-raf inhibit the
ability of activin to induce molecular markers of both
dorsal and ventral mesoderm including Xbra, Mix! and
Xnot. Some transcriptional responses to activin such as

 

INTRODUCTION

During early Xenopus development, cells in the equatorial
region of the embryo adopt a mesodermal fate in response to
inductive signals emanating from the underlying endoderm. As
‘mesodermal subtypes are regionally specified during this
process and since mesoderm plays a critical role in gastrula
‘movements and neural induction, undestanding the nature of
the inductive signals and their response is erucial 19 under-
standing the molecular basis of pattern formation.

‘Several growth factors have been identified that can induce
‘mesoderm in explanted animal pole cells (animal caps)
(reviewed 1989; Whitman and Melton, 1989). Two
such factors, bFGF and activin, are present in the embryo
during the time of mesoderm induction (Asashima et a., 1991;
Kimelman et al., 1988; Slack et al., 1987). In animal cap
assays, both FGF and low concentrations of activin are capable
of inducing ventrolateral mesoderm such as mesenchyme,
kidney and muscle, while only high concentrations of activin
can efficiently induce dorsal mesodermal tissues such as
notochord (Green ct al, 1990; Slack et al., 1987; Sokol et al.,
1990). A wide variety’ of mesodermal response genes have
been identified during revent years, many of which can be
induced by either PGF or activin, These include Xbra (Smith

 

 

  

 

 

 

etal, 1991), Xhox3 (Ruiz i Altaba and Melion, 1989), Xion
(Costa et a, 1991) and Xn (von Dassow etal 1993)
However, a subset of mesodermal marker genes, such as
oosecoid (Cho etal, 1991) and Mex! (Rosa, 1989), appear 10
respond only to activin. Marker genes that respond solely 10

 

goosecoid and Xwni8 are inhibited less effectively than
‘others, however, suxuesting that there may differing
requirements for an FGF signal in the responses of
mesoderm-specific genes to activin induction. Despite the
requirement for this signaling pathway during activin
induction, downstream components ofthis pathway are not
activated in response to activin, suggesting that activin does
not signal directly through this pathway.

dermal markers, this suggests an apparent redundancy between
PGF und low level activin signaling,

‘The receptors for FGF and activin have been cloned and
‘encode a protein tyrosine kinase and a protein serine/threonine
kinase, respectively (Lee et al., 1989, Matthews and Vale,
1991), Expression of dominant inbibitory mutants of these
receptors has been shown to block ligand-mediated signaling,
and this effect is rescued by co-expression of wild-type
receptor, indicating that these receptors are indced responsible
For inductive responses in embryonic cells (Amaya etal, 1991;
Hemmati-Brivanlou and Melton, 1992). In embryos,
expression of a dominant inhibitory PGF receptor percurbs
posterior axial patterning (Amaya et al, 1991), while
expression of a dominant inhibitory activin receptor can, in the
most severe cases, completely block the formation of
‘mesoderm (Hemmati-Brivaniou and Melton, 1992). The latter
result is striking in light of the fact that FGF-signaling
pathways are stil functional in these embryos, Indeed, animal
cap explants expressing a dorninant inhibitory activin receptor
show increased responsiveness to exogenous FGF (Hemmati-
Brivanlou and Melton, 1992), making the lack of FGI
mesoderm in embryos expressing the dominant inhibitory
activin receptor puzzling. ‘These results suggest that although
FGF is capable of inducing mesoderm in animal cap assays. it
may not do so in whale embryos.

‘One approach to elucidating the roles of FGF and activin
during mesoderm induction is to examine and manipulate the
cealy cytosolic responses to these growth factors. The activin
receptor belongs t a novel family of (ransmembrane
serine/threonine kinases and litte progress has becn made
toward understanding how these receptors transmit signals
