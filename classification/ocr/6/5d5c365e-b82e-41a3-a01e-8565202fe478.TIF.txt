‘Summary

‘The mutagenic activities of dibenz{a,clanthracene (DBja.cJA), and its 11 der
phenols aad 2 oxepines, were studied in the TA100 strain of Salmonella typhimurium at doses Vat
0 to 20 4g/plate in the presence of a rat-liver $9 (9000 x g) preparation. Amon:
tested DBfa,cJA-10,11-diol was the most mutagenic compound. However, it was consistently less mi
