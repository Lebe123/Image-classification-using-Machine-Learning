‘Summary

The mutagenic activity of all 4 isomeric aminocarbazoles and 4 nitrocarbazoles
was evalutated in Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98, TA100 and TAIS3S.
All compounds were assayed both in the presence, and absence of liver homogenate
from Aroclor-treated rats. Among the aminocarbazoles, 2-aminocarbazole was found
to be most active in both tester strains, although somewhat less active than
2-aminofluorene. 3-Aminocarbazole was the only other isomer that was mutagenic
towards TA98 at the dose levels employed (5-200 jg). 4-Aminocarbazole was
moderately active in TA100, and I-aminocarbazole was inactive in both TA98 and
TA100. Similar differences in mutagenic potency and specificity towards the tester
strains were observed for the related series of nitrocarbazoles.

 

 

‘The mutagenic and carcinogenic activity of various heterocyclic aromatic amines
has been actively investigated in recent years, The isolation and structural elucida-

2-amino-5-phenylpyridine, 2-amino-9H-pyridol2,3-bjindoles, and 2-amino-imidazo-

Pyrolysates and cooked food have contributed to interest in their potential ‘toxic
effects. Studies in our laboratories have indicated that aminocarbazoles are major
contributors to the mutagenicity of the semi-volatile components of tobacco (LaVoie
et al, 1980). Each possible isomeric nitrocarbazole was synthesized and subjected to
