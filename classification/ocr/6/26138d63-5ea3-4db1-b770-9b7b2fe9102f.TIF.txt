IN VITRO T CELL-MEDIATED KILLING OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA

IV. Nonresponsiveness in Polysaccharide-immunized BALB/c Mice Is Attributable
to Vinblastine-Sensitive Suppressor T Cells*

We reported previously that BALB/c mice immu-
nized with a polysaccharide (PS) antigen isolated
from immunotype 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and

nosa by secretion of a bactericidal lymphokine.
BALB/c mice immunized with PS alone generate
neliner protective antibodies nor a protective cell
response. The current studies indicate that T cells
from mice immunized with PS alone significantly
suppress the bactericidal activity of T tells from
mice immunized with vinblastine and PS. The sup.
Pressor T cells are of the same Lyt-1-,2°, IJ" phe-
Botype as the bactericidal T cells. Suppression is
mediated by a soluble product of these suppressor

interferes with the production or release of the bac:

other systems to remove suppressor T cells, fails to

Smmunization with PS elicits responses in two func:
