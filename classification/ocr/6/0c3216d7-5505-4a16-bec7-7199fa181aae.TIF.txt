‘Six beahhy young volunteers with no history of ative smoking were asked 10 keep on their Western

Known pro- and/or anti-mutagen-containing foods and drinks, 24 before ané during the experiments
‘They were xpoted passively 10 cigarette smoke produced by 4 habitual smoker in an unventiated 48.6
im? room for Bb. The carbon monouideconceniration was 18.85 2 7.3 ppm during the &- exposure,

Frameshift mutagens were loated from 0-H urine samples using chloroform and were tested for

INTRODUCTION

Inconsistent evidence exists in the literature concerning the recovery of mut
‘excreted in urine after passive smoking. Bos et al. [1] reported, for the first time,
that 12+h urine of nonsmokers staying in a smoky room for 6 h was mutagenic. In
contrast, the 1985 report of Sorsa et al. [2] indicated no significant (although sug-
Bestive) difference between urine mutagenicity before and after passive smoking
heir subjects were habitual smokers after a 48-72 h smoking cessation). The very
recent paper of Scherer et al. [3]| indicates non-mutagenicity of the urine of
