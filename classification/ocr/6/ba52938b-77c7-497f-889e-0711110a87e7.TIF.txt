‘The attenuated GIP regulation adenslyl eyelase (CDC3S)
lysates or membranes prepared from cells of a ede25*
strain is enhanced 2.5- to 6-fold by mixing these lysates
for membranes with lysates or membranes from a
ede35* strain harboring wild-type CDC25. The kineties
of activation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae adenylyl
cyclase in vitro is first order, as is the activation of
mammalian adenylyl cyclase, “Th

Present in the cell. When GppNHp was used the rate of
activation of the cyclase in a strain harboring a multicopy
plasmid of CDC25 was 7.0-fold higher than the rate

of adenylyl cyclase activation from a strain with a

in an isogenic strain containing the CDC2S gene on a
multicopy plasmid, ‘The reconstitution experiments

experiments and the kinetic experiments may also provide
A biochemical assay for the CDC25 protein and ean form

show that adenylyl cyclase activity in rasiras2bye! cells
is found in the soluble fraction, whereas in wild-type
strain it is found in the membrane fraction. Overexpres-
sion of the gene CDC25 in the rasirasdheyl strain
relocalizes adenylyl cyclase activity to the m
fraction. This finding suggests a bioelemical link between
CDC2S and CDC3S in the absence of RAS, in addition

Introduction

‘ras isa family of protooncogenes which are highly conserved
in evolution from yeast to mun. Although ras genes are
expressed in most marnsalian tissues and a mutated form
of ras is found in many hursan tumors as well as in tumor
Viruses (for reviews, see Barbacid, 1987; Lowy and
Willumsen, 1986), their function in mammalian cells is
unknown, The products of mammalian ras genes are stall
‘menibrane assuciated proceins (mol. wt 21 ka) which, like
heterotrimeric GTP binding proteins (G proteins), ‘bind
guanine nucleotides with high affinity and hydrolyze GTP.

G proteins are activated by ligaral bound hormone receptors
‘which regulate the exchange reaction from GDP to GTP in
4 frst order reaction, The active (GTP bound) G protein
then uctivates intracellular effectors (Gilman, 1987),
Mammalian ray proteins too are helioved to mediate the
transduction of an as yet unknown proliferative signal to an
as yet unknown effector.  rovently reported candidate for
the ras effector in mammmtalian cells isthe GTPase-activating
protein (GAP) described by Tratsey and McCormick (1987:
for review, see McCormick, 1989)

Inthe yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae which cantains two
RAS genes, the RAS effector is knows to be the adlenylyt
cyclase (Toda et al, 1985). Yeust cells that tek an active
RAS protein do not proiuce cAMP and are tot viable less
extremely active protein kinases ae present inthe cell. The
adenylyl eyclase activity in men:oranes prepared from these
‘mutated cells is not sensitive to GTP. The sensitivity to GTP.
and cell viability can be restores, however, if either yeast
hhuman or viral RAS gene is intoxiced into the mutated eel
(Clark et al, 1985; Katuoka er ai, 198Sa). The sensitivity
‘of the adenylyl eyclase co GIP in w'embranes prepared trom
RAS doticient yeast evlls is restored in vitro if purified
RAS proteins ure added to the membrane preparation (Broek
etal., 1985). On the other harnl, yeast ces that contain an

derepressed cells the CAMP tovet rises 3- to Sefold within

Although the exact biochemical nschanism of this activity
is unknown, the quick rise in cAMP concentration is totally
dependent on the presence ofan active RAS gene in the eel
(Monyi et al., 1988) and on the presence of another gene,
