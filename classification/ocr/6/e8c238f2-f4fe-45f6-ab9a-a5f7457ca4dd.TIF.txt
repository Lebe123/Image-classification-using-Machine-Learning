We report a positive association between the human peripheral blood natrsl killer

INTRODUCTION

A general decline in both cell-mediated and humoral immunity in aging is a
common observation in experimental animals and man (1,2). While certain con
ponents of the immune system are depressed, others are enhanced. In particular,
fn increased proportion of T lymphocytes which bear Fe receptors for IgG has,
been noted in older individuals (3, 4). Natural killer (NK) cells, which are Fe
receptor positive lymphocytes, are believed to play a role in immunosurveillance:
viral infection, and hemopoietic regulation (S, 6). In view of the higher incidence
of tumors in aged humans, attempts have been made to evaluate any possible
correlation between the basal NK activity and age. Also, a central question
among previous (7~10) and present investigators is whether # relationship exists
between human survival and the NK component of the immune system and. if so,
could NK activity be a determinant for longevity? Prior studies show conflicting
