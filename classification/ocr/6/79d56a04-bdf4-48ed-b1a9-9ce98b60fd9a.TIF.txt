Introduction

The neurotransmitter acetylcholine elicits rapid responses
by interacting with nicotinic receptors (nACHRS) and slower
elfects via muscarinic receptors (mACHRs). Muscarinic
‘Tesponses are observed in the central and peripheral nervous
system as wel as in muscle and in glands and represent alarge
proportion of the acetylcholine-mediated effects. Due to the
exrzordinarily high number of nAChRs found in the post
synaptic membrane of the electromotor synapses of electrie
fish, knowledge of the mechanism and structure of mACHRS
has increased tremendously in recent years (Changeux, 1981).
‘Advances in research on mACARs have been much less rapid.
This i due to the lower concentration of mACHRs, together
with the fact that these receptors have not yet been purified.

Earlier radioligand binding studies revealed that mAChRS
are discrete membrane components which recognize an-
tagonist and agonist molecules (Gorissen etal. 1978; Birdsall
et al, 1979; Haga, 1980). As is the case with many other
receptor systems, the two types of ligands appear to differ in
their mechanisms of interaction in the following way: only
agonists induce receptor desensitization in intact cell preparae
tions (Klein ef a, 1979; Simon and Klein, 1979): the recep.
tors are composed of different subpopulations with the same
affinity for antagonists but different affinities for agonists

‘and Mg?* ions have opposite effects on agonist affinity but
‘no effect on antagonist binding (Ehlert etal, 1981; Wei and
Sulakhe, 1980; Sokolovsky et al. 1980); and Finally, agonists
bot not antagonists induce conformational changes in the
receptors (Vauquelin et af, 1982).

mACHRS have been successfully solubilized with a wide
variety of detergents, of which digitonin appears to be the
‘most effective (Gorissen et al, 1981; Ruess and Lieflander,
1979; Hurko, 1978; Aaronstam ef a., 1978; Repke and Mat.
thies, 1980). ‘An affinity gel with high affinity for mACARS
(Repke ef al. 1980) has been described recently and a
purification of hydrophobic mAChR and nACHR proteins
‘was attempted earlier (Barrantes ef a, 1975). We report here
the first successful purification of mACHRS, These receptors
were solubilized with digitonin, purifted by absorption on an
affinity gel with dexetimide followed by selective elution with
the MACHR antagonist atropine or with the highly specific
irreversible ligand propylbenzilyicholine mustard (PrBCM).
‘The radiciodinated purified proteins were analysed by SDS-
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).

‘Agonists bind 10 two different clases of binding sites on

references therein). We found only low. affinity sites in 1%
Aigionin-solubilized preparations: the Hofste plots of the
competition binding (data not shown) were rectilinear, and
yielded 1C-50 values of 1.4. 0.07 mM for earbachal and
0.45 + 0.04 mM for acetylcholine. Xp values, calculated
from the IC-$0 values by the method of ‘Cheng and Prusoff
(1973) and Chou (1974), were 0,70 0.04 mM and 0.23 2
