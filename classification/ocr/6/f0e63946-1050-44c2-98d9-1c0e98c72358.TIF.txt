Investigations of Indoor Air Quality
at Four Large Office Buildings

Guy B. Oldaker I, Ph.D. W. David Taylor, MPh, CIH, CSP; Ken B. Parrish, BSME, P-E.

‘ABSTRACT

Investigations were performed in four large office
buildings 1 assess the relationships artong ventilation,
smoking actixty and indicators of indoor air quality
(AQ). Two types of beating, venillaiing and aircon
<Altiontng (HVAC) systems were examined: constant air
tolume (CAV) and variable air volume (VAY). Two types
of smoking policy were examined: unrestricted smoking
land smoking restricted 10 designated lounges. Toe four
‘buildings represented allcombinations ofthese four vari-
‘ables. One floor of each building was investigated, wi
measurements conducted during tbe summer when
HVAC tems were not in economizer mode, bey used
‘minimal outcide air, Inspections of tbe HVAC systems
Indicated that ther operation and maintenance were
acceptable, Ventilation wae measured by standard pro-

Cadre based on vlocly traverses.

‘During the ets, al oureystems provided ventilation
rates exentally conforming 10 ASHRAE Standard 62-
1989. ndicatorsofairqualily avd environmental bac
co smoke (ETS) were determined in outside and
returvairsireanss and offices 1AQ indicators included
respirable suspended particles (RSP), formaldehyde,
tolaile organic compounds (VOC), carbon dioxide
(C02) and carbon monaxide (CO). ETS indicators fn-
‘duded ulravolet particulate maiter(UVPM), fluorescent
particulate maiter(FPM) and nicotine. Smoking activity
twat assessed by collecting and counting cigarette buts,

Results show that: (@) smoking activity bad a neglt-
_gible efect on contaminant levels in buildings were
Smoking was unrestricted; (b) resriciing smoking 10
lounges eliminated ronsmoker exposure to ETS by
preventing smoke from dispersing fo adjacent areas; and
(with be HVAC systems adequately designed, operated
fn aceordasice with the current ASHRAE Standard and
properly maintained, all indicators were well within
‘opplicable standards, regardless ofthe smoking policy.

INTRODUCTION

‘Over the past decade there has been an increasing
awareness of the role thatthe indoor environment can
have in determining tol exposure to airbome con-
taminants, A considerable amount of research has been
done to ascess exposures in various microenvironments
such ashomes, offices, restaurants, and aircraft cabins to
lis but a few, Research also has been done to assess
exposure to specifi classes of contaminants, such 25
volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Partof our research
program [Oldaker, 1990] has been directed at assessing
exposure in offices (0 environmental tobacco smoke
(ETS), which is defined as the diluted and aged mire
of sidestream smoke and exhaled mainsiream smoke
‘which originates from buming tobacco (National Re
search Counll, 1986.

‘Generally, the level ofa contaminant in the indoor
airisthe result ofthe interplay between the sources of the
‘contaminant and factors that remove the contami
fee, “sinks” For most contaminants, ventilation isthe
rain removal factor. (AS used here ventilation is the
process where non-contaminated outdoor alriseffective-
ly disisbuted and exhausted in order to dilute and dis-
perse contaminants and to prevent pollution) The
‘American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Ai-Con-
itioning Engineers (ASHRAE) has published Standard
62-1989 tiled “Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air
Quality" IASHRAE, 1999]. This consensus standard gives
two procedures for demonstrating acceptable indoor air
‘quality (AQ). One procedure involvesassessing whether
Ventilation rates, generally in terms of cubic feet pet
‘minute (CFM) outdoor air per occupant, conform with
‘Values tabulated in the Standard on the basis of microen
vironment, The other procedure involves measuring
levels of contaminants to ensure that they are within
specified levels,

“The investigations reported here were done because
there existed no quantitative information on the effect of
smoking on office 1AQ within the context of ASHRAE
Standard 62-1989,
