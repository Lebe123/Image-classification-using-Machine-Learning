[EXPOSURE TO ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE
‘Charaeteratien of Envirsnmental Tehscce Smoke
Nonsmokers inhale environmental tobacco smoke.
‘the combination of the sidestream smoke that is
released from the cigarettes burning end and the
mainstream smoke exhaled by the active smoker
Exposure to involuntary and active smoking differ
quantitatively and, to some extent, qualitatively >>"
Because of the lower temperature in the burning
cone of the smoldering cigarette, most partial pyro=
lytic products are enriched in sidestream as com-
paredto mainstream smoke. Consequently, side-
stream smoke has higher concentrations of some
toxic and carcinogenic substances than does main-
stream smoke; however, dilution by room air mark.
‘edly reduces the concentrations inhaled by the in-
voluntary smoker in comparison to those inhaled by
the active smoker. Nevertheless, involurary smoking
is accompanied by exposure to many of the toxic
agents generated by tobacco combustion 22”
