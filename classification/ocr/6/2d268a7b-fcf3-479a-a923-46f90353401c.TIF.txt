Summary

‘A turbidimetric rate method for the determination of immunoglobulins IgG,
IgA, and IgM has been adapted to an automatic kinetic rate analyzer. The pro-
cedure can be run on mildly lipemic sera without correction for sample light
scatter. We report correlations with results by an immunodiffusion method and

a manual laser nephelometric technique. The automated rate procedure

C described provides a rapid, accurate, precise and sensitive way to measure
immunoglobulins.

Introduction

During the past few years there has been considerable clinical interest in
developing convenient automated analyses for specific immunoglobulins [1,2].
Although the precipitin reaction was first identified by Krauss in 1897 [3] and
‘the manual nephelometzic quantitative analysis of specific proteins was
described by Libby in 1938 [4,5], it has been the recent commercial availability
of high quality monospecific antiserum that has led to the development of
automated nephelometrie and turbidimetric analyses. The automated equilib-
rium techniques developed on continuous flow instrumentation [6,7] and cen-
trifugal analyzers [8,9] all require sample blanks due to nonspecific light scat-
ter. In an‘attempt to correct for sample induced light scatter a reaction rate
analyzer was adapted using an early post mixing reading [10]. A rate method
of detecting antibody immunoglobulin complexes was developed on a centri-
fugal analyzer modified with a laser for light scatter measurements (11—14].

‘We have adapted the rate technique which offers the advantage of automatic
blank correction to the Perkin Elmer KA-150 kinetic analyzer. The method
described here gives excellent sensitivity and a large working range for immuno-
gobylins IgG, IgA and IgM.
