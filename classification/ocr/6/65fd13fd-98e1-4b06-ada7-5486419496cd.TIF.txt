thinytwo factors related to childhood asthma were studied in 200 asthmatic children. Remission of asthma was
ned as a period of atleast 2 years free of asthma while receiving no treaiment. Univariate analysis showed
Saffeant associations between persistence of asthma and perennial symptoms with an odds rato (OR) of 2.5 (95%
fer" tence intervals 1.2 £0 5.5) sensitization fo house dust mites OR 3.5 (1.2 to 9.6); sensitization to molds, OR 7.9
1216); sensitization 10 pollen, OR 48 (1.4 10 16.3): and sensitization to milk protein, OR $.4 (1-8 10 15.9).
Fiere was a positive association of remission of asthma with good treatment compltance, OR 12.1 (1.6 091.6). A
‘eeise logistic regression analysis selected the variables: perennial symptoms (S: 0 = no, 1 = yes), length of foliow-.
ipiime (T: number of months), treatment compliance (C: 0 = poor, | = good), sensitization to fungi (F: 0 t0°4), and
