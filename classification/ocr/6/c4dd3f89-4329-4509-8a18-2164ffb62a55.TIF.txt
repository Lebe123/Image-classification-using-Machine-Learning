Abstract. Nine human melanoma cell lines established in our
laboratory were analyzed for p53 gene expression and their
‘tumorigenic and metastatic potential in nude mice. Northern
blot analyses showed that ive ofthe cell lines (55%) had ether
‘complete loss or low levels of p53 transcripts. Immmunocytoche-
‘mical analysis for p53 protein expression agreed with mRNA
analysis results, Nucleotide sequencing showed no mutations
inexons 5 through 8 of the gene. All cell ines except one gave
rise 10 tumors at subcutaneous inoculation sites in nude mice.
The melanoma cell line UISO-MEL-6, completely lacking p53
expression, spontaneously metastasized to tung and liver in
nude mice.

Homan melanoma develops in a sequence of steps: from
benign proliferative lesions of normal melanocytes, to prim-
ary melanomas, to locally invasive melanomas and metastasis,
(1). Conventional surgical procedures are curative in most
Patients with early localized primary melanoma; however,
the prognosis is grave once the disease metastasizes (2-4). In
the past few years, efforts have been made to identify major
‘events that lead to the development of melanoma and its
Progression to metastasis. Stil, the genes and molecules
which might play an important role in melanoma genesis are
not identified.

Several studies detected ras gene activation in. human
melanoma (5-7). Expression of epidermal growth facior
receptor gene has been implicated in melanoma metastases
(6,9). Recent studies indicate that tumor suppressor p33 may
play an important role inthe development and progression of

‘melanoma (10-12). P53 alteratioys were frequently detected
in cutaneous and choroidal melanoma (11,12). This gene
appears to be central tothe development of human malignan-
ies, because, in different tumor types, both alleles ae often
‘mutated (13). Human malignant cels lacking normal p33
‘expression, when transfected with wildtype pS3, grew at a
slower rate in culture (14-17) and had reduced tumorigenicity
in nude mice (18). Although many studies suggest that p53
alteration in melanoma is probably more frequent than is
generally recognized, the exact incidence and mechanism of
its influence on initiation, growth, and progression of human
‘melanoma need to be further investigated

In the studies reported here, we analyzed nine metastatic
‘melanoma cell lines for pS3 expression at the RNA. and
protein levels, by both molecular and immunocytochemical
approaches, We also searched these cel lnes for mutations in
‘exons 5 through 8 of the p53 gene, where mutations most
frequently occur in other malignancies. We then investigated
‘whether different levels of p53 gene expression are correlated
with tumor growth potential and metastatic behavior of the
‘melanoma cet lines in vivo. In our study, the melanoma cel
line completely lacking p53 expression metastasized spon-
taneously in nude mice.

Cal tines n these studies, we wsed human melanoma cll ines which
ere derived from metasati tumor specimens (UISO MEL2, 3,46,
7, ll, 16, and 23), foreskin meanootc eel Hine, and moval

line (WSI)estabised in our aberatory (19). Te human

[Norther bio analysis. Total RNA was slated from ech ell ne wing
the method of Chirgin era (21). Northern analy was performed wing
formaldehyde denaturation gels ss previously reported (22,25). The
‘human ful-tength p53 eDNA fragment (1.3 Kb), wed as a probe, was
‘slated from the plasmid hugs (SP6) (Oncogene Science) by digesting
vith ECORVAindI restrcdon enzymes and separating on low meling
gare ge. Te radiolabeled probe was gencrated by using the random
Primed elongation procedure (2).
