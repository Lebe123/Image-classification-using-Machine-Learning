Many thousands of animals are used every year to study aspects of inhalation
toxicity. IF the standard of husbandey of the experimental animals before
and during use allows variability in parameters such as ammonia build-up,
the results obtained can only be an inaccurate assessment of the true reaction
to any procedure.

Scientists should be aware that environmental control in theie animal houses
is just as important as overt disease control forthe validity of tir experimental
results
