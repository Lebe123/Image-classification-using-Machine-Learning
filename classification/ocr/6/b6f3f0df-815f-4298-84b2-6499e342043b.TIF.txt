Toxicity in Rabbits, and a Developmental Toxicity
Screen in Rats

ABSTRACT

‘The methyl, ethyl, and butyl ethers of triethylene glycol (TM, TE, and TB, respectively) were
evaluated in three screening studies to assess their potential hazards to humans. The assessments
included (1) an in vitro procedure to determine the ability of the materials to penetrate human
skin, (2) 21-day dermal limit test in rabbits to determine potential systemic toxicities, and (3) a
screening procedure to evaluate the chemicals’ potentials to induce developmental toxicity. In
the in vitro dermal absorption procedure, the three test materials crossed human epidermis at
‘molar rates 170-330 times more slowly than the lower molecular weight homolog ethylene glycol
‘methyl ether (EM), a chemical known to induce systemic eects folowing skin application. In the
21-day dermal study, daily applications of 1000 mg/kg TM, TE, or TB did not produce systemic
toxicity in male or female rabbits, including hematologic or testicular effects. The low dermal
penetration rate of the triethylene glycol ethers may have played a role inthis outcome. In the
developmental toxicity screening test, oral doses of 1000 mg/kg given on Days 6-15 of gestation
did not produce maternal toxicity in rats and had no effect on viability or growth of offspring,
pre- or postnatally, indicating low developmental toxic potential for these compounds. The
resulls ofthese studies indicate that triethylene glycol methyl, ethyl, and butyl ethers have very
low capacities tobe absorbed through the skin of exposed individuals, low potentials to produce
systemic toxicity following oral or dermal exposures, and do not appear to be selectively toxic to
the developing conceptus. The data clearly indicate that triethylene glycol ethers do not exhibit
toxicologic profiles comparable to those ofthe methyl and ethyl ethers of ethylene glycol.
