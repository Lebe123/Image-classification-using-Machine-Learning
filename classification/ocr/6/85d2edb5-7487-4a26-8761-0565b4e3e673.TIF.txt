Cigarette smoking is the leading, single, preventable cause of death in
industealized Western societies (USDHHS (1982, p. xi)]. Between 4.000 and
5,000 premature deaths in Switzerland are attributed to smoking each year
CLeu and Schaub (1983s, b)) and annual economic costs of smoking amount
{o 600-800 million Swiss francs oF roughly 47% of GNP [Leu (19822)].
Reduction of the level of smoking has become a major public heaith issue i
recent years

The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of two policy
instruments which may be employed by governments to reduce per capita
cigarette consumption: taxation and antimoking publicity. Time series
cigarette sales data for Switzerland between 1954 and 1981 are analyecd.

Several hypotheses are tested about how taxation and publicity have
influenced cigarette demand. In particular, the study focuses’ on longcterm
‘effects of publicity, on indirect effects between publicity and taxation, aed on
the ‘relative importance of the two policy instruments as deterents of
Cigarette consumption. The results imply that anti-smoking publicity did
have a substantial permanent impact and that there were important indirect
effects between publicity and taxation.
