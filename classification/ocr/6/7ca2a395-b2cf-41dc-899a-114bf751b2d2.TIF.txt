Preferences for retirement age measure the suength of the social values regarding
sisengagement from the occupational role. During the present era of social change, when
‘social values tend t0 lag behind technological change as expressed in the occupational
tole, preferred retirement age may diverge from actual retirement age. If events dictate
retirement earlier than one is ready to accept, serious social problems may orise
Particular examples are the problems of post-tetirement adjustment and the need for

‘Two sources of pressure fiom the industrial and medical subsectors combine to
influence these problems. The indusinal subsector has vastly increased. productivity,
Fewer man-hours are necessary, therefore the work life can be curtailed at an earlier age

Another effect is the decreased importance of physical capability for work capacity a5
manifested by proportional decrease in ranual occupations. This would make it possible
to extend the work hfe despite physical decrement with age. A third effect is an increase
in consumer goods, socioeconomic status, and standard of living all of which tend to
improve health and longevity. The higher standard of living also tends to prolong the
capacity for work by slowing down physical deciement with age. Another aspect of
higher standard of hwving is the ability to accumulate resources within a shorter work life,
$0 that a longer post-retirement period can be supported. Similar effects come from the
medical subsector which provides better medical technology, improving thereby health

and longevity.
