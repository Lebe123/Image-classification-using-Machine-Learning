Inhibntors of eysteme proicinases have been used exienswvely to dissect the roles ofthese protemasesm cell. Surprisingly
though. litle work has been performed to demonsirate unequivocally thatthe inhibitors Feach and inactivate the rget

Benzyloxycarbonsl (Z1""Ijodo-Tyr-Ala-diazomethane (CHN,). an rabsor of cathepsins Land B, has been shown to
label acuve forms of these enrymes in lysosomes and whole cells. The abulaty of other eysiine proteinase inhNbicors 10
