Mechanisms of Cell Fusion
and Selection in the
Generation of Hybridomas

‘Frame METHODS OF HYBRIDOMA FORMATION.
By

Jerry W. Shay

1. Introduction

‘The hybridoma technology for the production of monoclonal
antibodies was initially reported by Kehler and Milstein in 1975
{(), but its discovery was actually the culmination of advances in
‘several unrelated fields of research. In this review the various cell
fusion and selection techniques that allowed for the development
(of the hybridoma technology will be considered. In addition, some
recent advances in cell hybridization and selection procedures that
tRay be useful in enhancing the production of hybridomas will be

2. Historical Review

In 1960, Barski and coworkers (2) observed the spontaneous
fusion of cells in culture. Okada and Tadokoro (3) d that
Sendai virus could increase the number of fused cells from a rare
spontaneous event to a much more efficient and predictable
