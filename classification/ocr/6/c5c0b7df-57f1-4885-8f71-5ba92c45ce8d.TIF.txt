ABSTRACT The techniques of quick freezing and freeze-drying provide an

alternative to the more classical methoviologies of chemical fixation and dehy:
dration with organic solvents. I is posible to embed freeze-dried tissue in low

icosity resins, either at rom temperature or at subzoro temporatures in
Spure's resin or Lowieryl KAM, respectively. The choice of embedding medium
‘affords additional flexibility in pastdrying and embedding conditions, since
SSpurr’s resin allows vapor fixation with osmium tetroxide and thermal poly-
‘merization, Osmitum tetroxide is not recommended for Lowieryl resins, but
these media permit polymerization at subzero temperatures with ultraviolet
Tight. Both resins have unique advantages that may be utilized, depending
"upon the purpose of the embedding.

In this paper, we diseuss the details of preparing smooth muscle, from rabbit
renal artery, by quick freezing and freezedrying, as well as methods for the
embedding of the freeze-dried tissue in both Spurr’s resin and Lowery! K4M.
‘Although we have previously reported the ultrastructure of smooth muscle
tmbedded in Spurr's low viscosity vesin, the combination of freezedrying and
infileration in Lowieryl K4M represents « new approach that allows the elimi:
nation of chemical fixation, dehydration with organic solvents, ané heat poly
merization of the embedding medium.

removable embedding media (Capco et al,
1984; Wolosewiek, 1980, 1984), the majority
of these methods still rely on some form of
chemical fixation andor dehydration.

‘One method of bypassing chemical fixation
is to rapidly freeze the specimen. In its sim-
plest definition, rapid freezing

The method of freczing depends upon the
nature of the specimen. The most widely used
techniques involve plunging a sample int
