ABSTRACT

‘An understanding of the radiobiological effects of igh LET radiation is essential for human
risk estimation and radiation protection. In the present study, we show that a single, 30
cGy dose of 150 keV/m 4He ions can malignantly transform human papillomavirus
immortalized human bronchial epithelial [BEP2D] cells. Transformed cells produce
progressively growing tumors in nude mice. The transformation frequency by the single
dose of alpha particles is estimated to be approximately 4 X10*7. Based on the average
cross-sectional area of BEP2D cells, it can be calculated that @ mean traversal of 1.4
particles per cell is sufficient to induce tumorigenic conversion of these cells 3 to 4 months
post-itradiation, Tumorigenic BEP2D cells overexpress mutated p53 tumor suppressor
‘oncoproteins in addition to the cell cycle control gene cyclin DI and D2. This model
provides an opportunity to study the cellular and molecular changes at the various stages in
radiation carcinogenesis involving human cells

 

INTRODUCTION

‘The natural radiation environment outside the magnetic shielding of the earth is rather
‘complex and consists of a mixed field of high energy protons, electrons, alpha particles
and heavy ions. As the era of manned space exploration of our solar system becomes
increasingly a reality rather than a myth, the potential exposure of astronauts to these high
linear energy transfer [LET] radiations and the subsequent short and long term health
effects on the crews become @ major concern of the space agency. The potential health
problems facing the astronauts from high LET radiation in space include such late effects
as cataract induction, gene and chromosomal mutations and carcinogenesis /1/. The
principal stochastic risk associated with radiation exposure in space is cancer induction for
which there is no human data base available /1,2/. In addition, accurate cisk assessment for
human exposure to ionizing radiations has traditionally been compromised, in that reliable
data are available only for substantial doses and extrapolations must be made down to the
ow dose region of interest in radiation protection

In vitro oncogenic transformation based on rodent cell models has been used to assess the
carcinogenic potential of high LET radiations /3-5/. In particular, a single exposure to
either high or low LET radiations has been used successfully to transform rodent cells in
culture. High LET radiation, in general, is more efficient in transforming cells than X or y-
rays at equivalent doses with a relative biological effectiveness that ranges from 2.2 10 10 /
