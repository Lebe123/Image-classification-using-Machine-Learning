A Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Made! for Nicotine
Disposition in che Sprague-Dauiley Rat. PLowcwtk, D. Ro.

A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PRPK) mode!
was developed to describe the disposition of nicotine in the
Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat, Parameters for the model were
cither obtained from the literature (blood flows, organ vol-
umes) or determined experimentally (partition coefficients)
Nicotine metabolism was defined in the liver compartsnent
by the first-order rate constants Ki and Kp which control
the rate of nicotine metabolism to cotinine and “polar me-
tabolites” (PM), respectively. These rate constants were es-
timated by optimizing the model fit to pharmacokinetic data
‘obtained by administering an intraarterial ($)-[5-H] nicotine
bolus of 0.1 mg/kg to 6 rats. Model simulations that optimized
for the appearance of cotinine in plasma estimated Kyc and
Kp to be 75.8 and 24.3 hr“*, respectively. Use of these con-
stants in the model allowed us to accurately predict nicotine
plasma kinetics and the fraction of the dose eliminated by
rena) (8.5%) and ruetabolic (91.5%) clearance. To validate
the model's ability 10 predict tissue kinetics of nicotine,
21 male SD rats were administered 0.1 mg/ke (S)-I5-
HiJnicotine intraarterially. At seven time points following
treatment, 3 rats were euthanized and tissues were removed
and analyzed for nicotine. Model-predicted nicotine tissue
kinetics were in agreement with those determined experi-
mentally in muscle, liver, skin, fat, and kidney, The brain,
heact, and lung exhibited nonlinear nicotine elimination, sag
‘esting that saturable nicotinic binding sites may be important
in nicotine disposition in these organs. Inclusion of saturable
receptor binding expressions in the mathematical description
of these compartments resulted in better agreement with the
experimental data, The Baa, and Ko estimated by model sim-
ulations for these tissues were brain, 0.009 and 0.125 lung,
0.039 and 2.0; and heart, 0.039 nmol/tissue and 0.12 ns,
respectively. This PBPK model can successfully describe
the tissue and plasma kineties of nicotine io the SD rat and

Human exposure to nicotine can occur through the con-
sumption of tobacco products, exposure to environmental
tobacco smoke (ETS), pharmaceuticals such as Nicorette
sgum, use of nicotine-based insecticides, and dietary sources
‘Sheen, 1988). Tobacco use represents the most substantial
exposure 10 nicotine. Surveys by the Centers for Disease
‘Control indicate that 26.5% ofthe adult US population are
smokers (CDC, 1987). This extensive use of tobacco in our
society has generated concern over the potential health risks
associated with nicotine (DHHS, 1989). Accurately pre-
dicting nicotine uptake and disposition in humans isa nec-
essary step in assessing the potential adverse health effects
of nicotine. Although plasma pharmacokinetics have been
extensively documented in animals(Kyerematen eta. 1982,
1987, 1988: Adir tal, 1976; Rotenberg et al. 1980) and
‘humans (Rosenberg ea, 1980; Scherer eral, 1988; Kyee
ematen «al, 1990), the relationship between plasmia con-
centrations, tissue concentrations, and pharmacologic or
toxicologc effects are not well understood,

The principal pharmacologic actions of nicotine are me-
ated through central and peripheral nicotinic receptors (Su,
1982; Lippielo and Fernandes, 1986). These effets bave
been reported tobe dose dependent znd include modulation
of cardiac functions (Rosenberg etal, 1980), brain electro
physiology (Clarke, 1990), and systemic vascular blood flow
(Benowitz e a, 1990: Henrich eral, 1984). In addition,
recent evidence that chronic nicotine administation results
{nan increas in the density of nicotinic cholinergic receptors
in the mammalian brain has resulted in. the experimental
administration of nicotine to Alzheimer’s patients (New-
house etal, 1988; Sahakian ef al, 1989). To understand
how these pharmacologic effects are related (0 aiotine ex-
