‘The regulatory control of human erythropoiesis through a

also induce human KS62 and mouse Friend cells to become

exhibited this inducing activity toward Friend cells was

activin A in the regulatory control of erythropoiesis.”
However, mechanisms of the action of activin A on the
process of erythropoiesis remain largely unknown,

proliferation is exerted indirectly, ie, through mediation of
both monocytes and T lymphocytes. It was also suggested
that activin A may drive immature erythroid precursors to
form hemoglobinized cells, thereby rendering the colonies,
recognizable as erythroid colonies*’ Conceivably, activin

activin A was found to induce accumulation of hemoglobins

the issues of the effects of activin A on highly purified
