‘The tumor promoter okadaic acid is a potont inhibitor of the serine/threonine
protein phosphatases 1 and 2A. Addition of okadaic acid to v-Sre-transformed
BALB/c 373 cells reverted them to a flat morphology, increased fibronectin levels in
the extracellular matrix, ceduced saturation density, and inhibited the formation of
colonies in soft agar. The ability of v-Sre-transformed cells to proliferate in low

Rous sarcoma virus encodes a protein-tyrosine kinase, v-Sre, which transforms
cells in culture and induces tumors in animals (1), The molecular events leading from
the protein-tyrosine kinase

activity of v-Sre to cellular transformation are poorly understood; however
been pointed out that transformation by v-Src leads to an increase in the
phosphorylation state of sevaral proteins on serine and threonine residues as well as
fon tyrosine (2-4). Due to the specificity of v-Sre for tyrosine residues, the increase
in serine/threonine phosphorylation must arise from either the activation of
serine/threonine-specitic protein kinases or the inhibition of phosphatases specific for
serine and threonine residues.
