SUMMARY

 

Evidence is presented that the previously observed decrease Of the Vinex
of hepatic microsomal demethylation of dimethyinitrosamine (DMN), fol
lowing pretreatment of rats with 3-methylcholanthrene (MC), is not dire to
increase in the rate of breakdown but to decrease of de novo synthesis. De-
terminations of Vg, at time intervals in the transition from the high steady-
state level induced by 2 carboltydrate-devoid casein diet, down to the low
steady-state level of carbohydrate-containing basal diet, yielded two consecu
tive slopes; descent from the basal diet level to the lower steady-state level
following pretreatment with MC yielded one slope. Plotting these slopes
against the initial Vin. values gave a typical exponential curve (or straight
line if the logs of slopes are used) indicating that the rate of enzyme decay in
the MC-reated animals is not greater than that exnected from normal en.
zyme catabolism. A multiplicity of effector sites appears to be involved in
the repressor action of different structural types; for example, repression bY
MC (46.62) and by phenobarbital (23.9%) in’ combination are approxi
mately additive (62.0%), rather than competitive, indicating that the two
agents act at different sites. A P-450 type cytochrome is involved in the
