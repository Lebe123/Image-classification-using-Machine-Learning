Effect of Sidestream Smoke (Passive Smoke) on Cell Viability
and Interferon Production*

G, Sonnenfelé

Summary

Several studies have been carried out to evaluate the toxicological effects of sidestream
smoke. The work carried out in out laboratory will be reviewed herein. Sidestream
(passive) smoke has been generated utilizing the peristaltic purp smoking machine. This
machine allows for simultaneous exposure of specimens to sidestream and mainstream
smoke. The target cells used were the murine 929 fibroblast-like cell line. Exposure of
these cells 10 sidestream smoke from the 2R! reference cigarette resulted in dose-
dependent cytotoxicity, Use of the JRAF reduced yield cigarete also resulted in dose-
dependent cytotoxicity. A lower dose of sidestream smoke from the IR4F cigarette was
requited to generate 80% cytotoxicity of L929 eels than when sidestream smoke from
the 2RI cigarette was used. The effects of sidestream smoke exposure on production of
interferon-alpha/beta, an antiviral, amicancer, and immunoregulatory substance, was
also determined. Production of interferon by 1-929 cells was inhibited severely after
‘exposure ofthe cells to non-<ytotoxie doses of sidestream smoke from the 2RI cigarette.
Filtration of the smoke through activated charcoal reduced the inhibition of interferon
production, In addition, aging of the smoke also resulted in reduction of the inhibition of
interferon induction.

Introduction

Over the past several years «peristaltic pump smoking machine has been used in our
laboratory to study the ability of sidestream (passive) smoke to induce various toxic
effects in a cell culture system. These i vitro studies will now be reviewed in this paper

“The smoke exposure system used was the peristaltic pump smoking machine
especially adapted for exposure of tissue cultures (Griffith 1985; Griffith and Hancock
1985). Cultures of -929 cells,a murine fibroblast-likeline, were grown to confluency and
exposed to sidestream smoke, The eytotoxic effects of the sidestream smoke generated
from a 2RI unfiltered reference cigarette were determined (Sonnenfeld et al, 1985). In
addition, these effects were compared withthe cytotoxic effects of sidestream smoke
from the IR&F filtered, ventilated, reduced yield experimental cigarette (Sonnenfeld and
Wilson 1987).

“The interferon system was originally described as an antivical defense system, but may
play a role in defenses against respiratory tract infections and cancer (Sonnenfeld and.
