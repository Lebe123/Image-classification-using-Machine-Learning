Fetal and infant growth and cardiovascular risk factors in women

CHD Fall, C Osmond, D JP Barker, PM $ Clark, CN Heles, Y Stirling, TW Meade

Abstract

Objective—To examine whether cardiovascular
risk factors in women are related to fetal and infant
roweh,

‘Design—Follow up study of women born 1923-30
whose birth weights and weights at one year were
recorded.

‘Seuting-—Hertfordshire.

‘Subjeceo—297 women born and stil living in East
Hertfordshire.

‘Main outcome measures—Plasma glucose and
insulin. concentrations during a standard oral

iucose tolerance test; fasting plasma proinsulin and
52:33 split proinsulin concentrations; blood pres-
‘sue; fasting serum total, low density lipoprotein and
high’ density Lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride,
‘and apolipoprotein AI and B concentrations: and
plasma fibrinogen and factor Vit concentrations.

ResultsFasting plasma concentrations of
slucose, insulin, and 32-33 split proinsulin fll with
increasing birth weight (P=008, P=0-002, and
P=0-0002 respectively, when current body mass
index was allowed for). Glucose and insulin concer
tations 120 minutes after an oral glucose lo
showed similar trends (P-0003 and P=0-02).
‘Systolic blood pressure, waisthip rato, and serum
‘mlplyceride concentrations also fell with increasing
birth weight (P=0-08, P=007, and P=0-07 respec
tively), while serum igh density. Upoprotein
cholesterol concentrations rose (P=0-04). At each
birth weight women who currently had a higher body
‘mass index had higher levels of risk factors

Conclusion—In women, as in men, reduced fetal
‘growth leads o insulin resistance and the associated
disorders: raised blood pressure and high serum
twiplyceride and low serum high density Upoprotein
cholesterol concentrations. The highest values of
these coronary risk factors occur in people who were
smuall at birth and become abese. In contrast with
‘men, low rates of infant growth did not predic levels
ofrisk factors in women.
