4. Introduction

ec Bungarotoxin (a-Bgt) has been a ligand of great
utility for characterising nicotinie acetylcholine recep-
tors (ACHR) in skeletal muscle. Consequently it was
the ligand first used to seek similar nACHR in the
vertebrate nervous system. In the 1970s specific bind
ing sites for [f]a-Bat, displaying a nicotinic pharma-
cology and heterogencous distribution were deseribed
in brain and ganglia (29], but these sites languished
without a function as ,Bgt was generally unable to
antagonise nicotinic responses elicited in neuronal
preparations [10]. The demise of Bgl binding sites as
putative nACHR was hastened by the demonstration of

‘The molecular cloning of cDNA’s coding for at least
ten putative mAChR subunits in vertebrate neural tis-
sues has revealed much more heterogeneity than previ-
ously anticipated [28]. These molecular strategies have

the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SYSY [24] en-
codes a subunit capable of forming robust homomeric

currents are characterised by rapid activation and de~
sensitisation kinetics, high permeability to Ca?" and
sensitivity to a-Bgt. Rather similar whole cell currents
have been described in cultured hippocampal neurons
(,2,39]. The rat hippocampus has a particularly high
density of a-Bgt binding sites {11}, shows very strong
