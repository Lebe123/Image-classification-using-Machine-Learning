Protein kinase Cis now known 1o be a large family of proteins, with multiple subspecies that have
subile individual enzymological characteristics. Some members of the family exhibit distinct patterns

SINCE iscovery in 1977, the enzyme profein kinase C (PKC)
has become a focus of attention for biologi interested in the
