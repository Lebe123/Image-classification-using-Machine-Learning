‘Alarge amount of time and effort has been put into developing methods to help smokers give
top their habit. In general, the results of these endeavours have not been impressive
(Schwarz, 1987). In Australia, 85% of current smokers have made anempts to quit (Borland
& Hill, 1988). Is clear that most quit anempts end in relapse, Such findings have led to
change in research emphasis, with some investigators beginning to focus on relapse episodes
(eg. Marat & Gordon, 1980, 1985: Shiffman, 1982; Shiffman & Jarvik, 1987). The aim
is t develop methods to reduce the occurrence of relapse. In the process of addressing this
goal itis imponant to obtain good descriptive information on the situations in which
Cigarenes are smoked after a period of abstinence (called slip-ups inthis paper) or in which
temputions occur which are overcome

‘Research into slip-up episodes is of two kinds, those that have provided a multivariate
eserition of slip-up context (e.g.. Cummings, Jaen, & Giovino, 1985; Shiffman, 1982)
and those that have sed the set of munully exclusive categories developed by Marla and
Gordon (1980) (e.g., O'Connell & Martin, 1987). It is difficult to directly compare the wo
methods; they will be dealt with separately. Descriptions of slip-up episodes have been
collected from both those who recovered from the slip-up but promptly resumed abstinence,
tnd those for whom the slip-up represented the beginning ofa relapse. In addition, several
‘authors (¢.g., O'Connell & Martin, 1987; Shiffman, 1982) have also studied crisis episodes
‘which didnot result in a slip-up (variously called close-calls or pea lapses) Shiffman (1982)
found that crises involving alcohol tended to result in slip-ups, and that crises that did not end
in slip-ups were associated with a broader range of cognitions. However, there is a major
‘methodological problem in comparing close-calls with actual slipups when they are both
recalled rezospectvely.

‘Crises that do not result in slip-up can only be defined by the individual through the
thoughts they have, whereas slip-ups ean be identified after the event independent of any
thoughts had at the time. This means that it is impossible to report on a resisted tempation
‘without having cognitions about it, while itis possible to have a slip-up with no associated
