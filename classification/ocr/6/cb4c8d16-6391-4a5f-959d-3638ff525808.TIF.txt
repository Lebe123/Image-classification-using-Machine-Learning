(COMPARISON BETWEEN THE METHOD OF CHOU AND TALALAY AND A NEW METHOD FOR THE ASSESSMENT
(OF THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF DRUGS: A MONTE-CARLO SIMULATION STUDY

 

Kenneth Cyrus and Wi

‘A Bethod has been developed and
tested for determining whether the combi-
nation of two agente is synergistic, ad-
ditive or antagonistic. The method con
sists of fitting a set of equations in =
hierarchical manner to dose-response data
with nonlinear regression, choosing the
model which best fits the data, and in-
terpreting the resulting parameter eati-
mates. Our method ie compared with that
of Chou and Talalay (Adv. Enz. Regul

22: 27-85, 1984) by conducting Monte-
Carlo simulations with both methods.

‘The Monte-Carlo simulations showed a
clear superiorty of our method over that
of Chou and Talalay for making decisions
regarding the nature of the interaction
between two drugs. The anjor problens of
the latter wethod stem from: (1). the
forced fitting of a straight line to a
nonlinear function; (2) an incorrect
extrapolation step from the above fitt
‘and (3) an incorrect equation for
calculating @ combination index (CI). Our
method performed well under many con-
ditions, and can be easily extended to
nore complex situations.

 

 

    

Introduction

‘The assessment of the combined ef-
fects of drugs is a field with a long,
rich history and a profound importance
for the present and future, The introd-
uctory sections of three recent articles
trace the development of the field
(Kedel1 and Pounds, 1983; Chow and
Talelay, 1984; Berenbaum, 1985). For the
sake of brevity the history will not be
included in thie paper.

‘The effect models presented in this
paper are only applicable to situations
Where effect is a continuous, monotonic
function of the drug dose. Thus, situ-
ations where the effect variable is quan-
tal, or not monotonic, or where data can
be Censored are not covered here.” Note
that the Nonlinear regression method will
hereafter be denoted as NLR, while the

yethod of Chou and Talalay will be
denoted as CAT.

Method:
Lor a For
single drug data, this mothod consiate of
fitting equation'1 to the data with non—
linear regression. (The definitions of
‘the nymbola used in all of the equations
in this paper are presented in Table 1.)

For the date from drug combinations this
method consists of fitting a set of
models, equations 1-7 to the date in a
Merarchienl sanner with nonlinear
regression, then determining which model
best fits the data, For data containing
proportional error (constant coefieient.
Of variation), weighted nonlinear regres
sion is also used with the weighting
factor for cach data point equal to the
‘squared reciprocal of the predicted
dependent variable.
