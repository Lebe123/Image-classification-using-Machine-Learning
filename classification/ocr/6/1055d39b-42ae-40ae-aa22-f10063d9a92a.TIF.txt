in vitro. This event is thought to be necessary for
activation of the enzyme. To determine whether such
a redistribution of protein kinase C occurs following
hormonally stimulated increases in cytoplasmic Ca*",
we measured [°H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (("HJPDB)
binding to protein kinase C in intact 1921N1 astrocy-
toma cells. The muscarinic agonist carbachol causes a
2-fold inerease in (*HJPDB binding. This increase is
transient, peaking at 1 min and returning toward con-
trol levels by 5 min, Seatchard analysis of (*H]PDB
binding in the presence of carbachol reveals a 2-fold
increase in the Bau. and no change in the Kp compared
to control values. This increase in Byax likely repre-
sents a redistribution of protein kinase C to the mem-
brane because ("HIPDB binding in intact cells is pre-
dominantly to membrane-associated enzyme. The Ca’
ionophore ionomycin, and two other Ca*-mobilizing
hormones, bradykinin and histamine, mimic the effects
of carbachol. Furthermore, when hormone-sensitive
Ca** stores are depleted by prior agonist treatment,
the carbachol-induced increases in intracellular [Ca**}
and (HIPDB binding are completely blocked. Under
these conditions, phosphoinositide hydrolysis and di
acylglycerol (DAG) formation are not inhibited. We
also examined the time course of DAG accumulation in
response to carbachol. DAG is not yet significantly
elevated when the increase in [HJPDB binding is max-
imal, Furthermore, [HJPDB binding has returned to
control levels when DAG concentrations are maxi-
mally elevated, These data suggest that hormone-stim-
ulated increases in cytoplasmic Ca** cause a marked
and rapid redistribution of protein kinase C which
recedes uny significant increase in DAG. Our findings
also demonstrate that {HJPDB binding to intact cells
may be a useful measure of the ability of Ca**-mobiliz-
ing hormones to affect protein kinase C.

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

“The Cat and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (pr0-
tein kinase C) exists as a peripheral membrane protein that
can be readily dissociated from the plasma membrane by
chelators (for review see Nishizuka, 1986). This ubiquitous
enzyme serves as the cellular receptor for both an endoge-

(Kishimoto et al, 1980 andl Bell, 1986), and a class of tumor
promoters, the phorbol estors (Castagna et al, 1983). DAG
‘and phorbol esters hind to and activate protein kinase C,
causing it to phosphorylate specific polypeptide substrates
‘and, thereby, affect cellular responses. An initial consequence
‘ofphorbol ester binding to protein kinase C is that the enayme
becomes more tightly associated with the plasma membrane
(Kraft and Anderson, 1982), Such redistribution of protein
kinase C from a loose association with the plasme membrane
‘to a more intogral association is also stimulated by Ca¥. fn
vitro studies of the binding of purified protein kinase C to
erythrocyte membranes reveal that Ca" alone, or synergisti
cally with phorbol esters, promotes the association of protein
kinase C with membrancs (Wolf et al, 1985). Therefore, it
Jhas been suggested that Cu"* plays a fole in “priming” the
activation of protein kinase C.

‘The extent to which physiological changes in the intracel-
Iular calcium concentration ({Ca"*}) affect protein kinase C
redistribution and, thus, its activation in vivo is not well
‘understood. One difficulty in assessing this phenomenon in
‘broken cells is that physiological changes in [Ca*] are diffi-
cult to preserve when tractionating cells. It is ertical that
fractionation conditions m:mic appropriate intracellular con-
ditions because protein kinase C distribution is especially
sensitive to Ca” and its chelators (May etal, 1985).

Reeults from two zecent reports implicate changes in cyto:
plasmic [Ca] in the regclation of protein kinase C redis
bution (Fearon and ‘Tashiian, 1987, and Dougherty and Nie-
Gel, 1986). Although Feacon and co-workers assessed protein
kinase C distribution after stimulating intact cells with hor-
mone, they measured protein kinase C activity in cell frac
tions. Dougherty and Niede! (1986) used [HJPDB binding to
intact phagocytes. to examine the relationship between
changes in intracelluler Cx” and the redistribution of protein
kinase C in the intact cel. They reported that agents thet
mobilize intracellular Cu” arw able to increase the sffinity of
protein kinase C for phorbol este.

In this study we have used [HJPDB binding to intact
1521N1 astrocytoma cells to better understand how hormone
induced changes in intracelular Ca®” affect protein kinase C
redistribution. ‘The method used circumvents problems asso:
ciated with evaluating the effects of Ca** on protein kinase
C-membrane interactions using fractionated cells. We report
that Ca*-mobilizing hormones (previously shown to induce
phosphorylation of protein kinase C substrates in these cells,
