Adehough asbeston enhancenent of cigarette ansking-nedeared human
lung cancers haa been tecognized for several years, the mecnanise of this
feahancenent rerains crypeic, Since (1) cigarette smoke cossiing Weentitied
chentcal carcinogens, (2) at least sone of these careizozexs sre sutagenicy
() sone of the induled mutations may convert procooncozenes into oncopeney
and (4) transformation of 8 norsal cell into a cancer col! apocars to requite
ore than one step, perhaps more than one oncogene, the ‘ollsvine hypetheste
was entertained: Asbestos Lacilitates the intercellutar transfer of onconene
DSA, thus increasing the probability of the presence of two oncogenes in the
sane cell, As an initial test, che capacity of asbestos to facilieate
transfection by viral preparation containing transfective sinle-stranded,
double-scranded, and mulei-stranded nucleic aciés was detersined.  Prepar
tions of ouch species of viral Aas vere obeained bv phoncl extraction of
high-titer serum-free harvests from poliovirus-infocted chispanzee cells.
hen such viral RNA preparations vere eixed vith asbestos and inoculated onto
washed cultures of chimpanzee cells, hundreds of plagues weve produced. when
the asbestoa vas onitted, no plaques vere produced, Ashestss mined directly
with the vieal RAA faciligated transfection such nore than achestor adeed £0
the colig either before of after the Snoculation of the viral RA, The asbes~
tos factiftation of transfection vas serongly dnuibited by adding ea)

sperm double-stranded ONA to the ‘noculun of viral ANA and asbestos.
now plan to test the capacity of asbestos co facilitate crassformation of
Cells by oncogene DNA.
