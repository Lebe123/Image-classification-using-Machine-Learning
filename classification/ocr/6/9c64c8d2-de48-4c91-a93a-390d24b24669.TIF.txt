ABSTRACT

In this study, immunotoxins containing monoctonal ant human
‘call leukemia antibodies are shown to be capabie of specie.
kaling of tuna T-leukeria cel in vitro.

These immunotoxins were prepared by conjugating rein A
chain (RIA) wath our recently generated murine monoclonal ant
boskes. SN1 and SN2, the latter of which was obtained trom @
hhybxidoma clone N6/D11 described previously by Negoro and
Seon (Cancer Res., 42: 4259-4262, 1982), directed to two
‘nique human T-cel leukemia antigens. We have shown previ=
‘us that these monoclonal antibadies do not react with non
leukemia cets nor with vanous normal cells including normal T-
cals, thymocytes, and bone marrow cells (Proc. Nat. Acad. So.
U.S. A, 69: 845, 1989; Cancer Res., 42: 4259, 1982). Control
‘conjugate was also prepared by conjugating RIA with a mutine
monoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG), the isotype of which is the
‘Same as that of SNJ and SN2, Le, IgGt-s. In nial experiments,
the cytotoxic activity of an SNI IgG-RIA conjugate preparation
{and the control IgG conjugate preparation against leukemic T-
Cet ines and normal B-cel ines was tested by two different test
Procedures, 1e., by measuring direct Killing of the cells and by
‘measuring inhibitory activity against protein synthesis inthe cells
In each test. the SN1 conjugate showed specific cytotoxic actv-
ity against T4eukemia cels, whereas the control conjugate was.
‘ot cytotoxic against either T-eukemia cells or normal B-cels,
"Nearly compete kiling of T-eukemia cols and inhibition of protein
synthesis in T-leukemia cols were observed at the concentra:
tions of 10°* to 10°” w of the SN1 IgG:RIA conjugate.

{a subsequent experiments, another preparation of SN1
IgGIRIA conjugate and an SN2 IgG:RIA conjugate preparation
‘were tested indvidvaly and together for their inubitory activity
‘aganst protein synthesis in T-eukemia cells and contro cel,
With T-leukemia cels, specific inhibition was observed for both
SNI IgGRRIA and SN2 IgGRIA. The combined use of these
‘conjugates did not display a synergistic effect. Nevertheless, the
combined use of diferent immunotoxins directed to oiferent
antigen molecules will be important in cleical use, since uncu-
{ured tumor cels derived freshly from patients, in general, dispay
heterogeneity with respect to the expression of tumor-associ
‘ated antigens. These immunotoxins may be useful forthe in vitro
eradication of tumor cells inthe bone marrow taken from patients
with T-cell leukemia. Such tumar celktree bone marrow spec
‘mens wal be very useful in autologous marrow transplantation
{o leukemia patients who have received aggressive high-dose
‘chemotherapy and rachotnerepy.

INTRODUCTION

‘Antibody carriers of toxins. termedimmunotoxins, have drawn
‘considerable attention recently because oftheir promising poten-
tian tumor therapy. Preparation of useful immunotoxins requires
‘appropriate specie antibodies; thus, monocional antitumor an-
tibodies will be very uselul. We have generated recently and
characterized several MCAbs® that are directed to human T-cell
leukemia antigens (14, 28), These MCAbs react with T-ALL ceils
but do not react with various non-Teukemia cells nor with
Various normal cell including normal - and B-cells, thymocytes,
and bone marrow ces. In the present study, we selected 2 of
these MCAbs, ie., SN1 and SN2, for preparing immunotoxins
IMCAb SN2 was obtained from hybxidoma clone N6/D11 de.
scribed previously (14)) These MCAbs define unique individual
human T-cell leukemia antigons (14, 28) and ate dlrected to
itferent antigen molecules as determined by specific immuno-
Prociptation followed by SDS-PAGE.‘ Of the toxins, we chose
icin, a plant toxin derived from the castor bean, since the
Useluiness ofthe antibody: RIA conjugates forthe in vito kiting
‘of tumor celis has been reported already by several groups of
investigators (6, 8-11, 15, 18, 28). Tho rcin molecule consists
‘of 2 subunits, an A and a 8 chain, which are inked by a dsulide
bond (reviewed in Re. 16). The 8 chain is a lectin which is.
pectic for galactose residues present on the surface of a wide
variety of cells. The binding of the ricin B chain to mammalian
Cells allows the ent of the entire rcin molecule, and conse-
quently the RIA, into the cytoplasm whore the A ehain is spit
from the 8 chain and acts on the 60S subunit of the iasome
to.cause irreversible inhibition of protein synthesis and cell death,
Isolated ncn 8 chain binds to cel surfaces butis nontoxic, while
isolated RIA is not significantly toxic because ofits inabilty to
<tficenty bind to cell surface and to traverse the cell membranes.
Thus, conjugates of RIA with appropriate monocional ant tumor
antibodies may provide immunotoxins specifically targeted on
the tumor cels that react with the antibodies.

(ur present immunotoxins of ant-Tleukeméa MCAbs and RIA
showed specite kiling of Teukemia ces in vitro. Chnicaluiil-
zation of such immunotoxins will be important in view of the
facts that T-col leukemia is associated with poor prognosis (1,
2,7. 17, 20, 22, 29) and that autologous marrow transplantation
Using leukemia cel-free bone marrow has promising potenti in
the cure of patents with T-cell leukemia (see “Discussion")
