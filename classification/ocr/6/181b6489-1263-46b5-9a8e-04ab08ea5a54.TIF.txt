 

Acute Lower Respiratory Iliness in Childhood as a Predictor of
Lung Function and Chronic Respiratory Symptoms?

DIANE R. GOLD, IRA 8. TAGER, SCOTT T. WEISS, TOR D. TOSTESON, and FRANK E. SPEIZEA

Inteduction
Acute lower respiratory illness (LRD in
‘arly childhood has been proposed as a
tisk factor, independent ofthe effet of
cigarete smoke, for lower level and slow-
er growth of lung function ater chilé-
hood and for faster decline of lung func
tion in adulthood (1,2). Because wheeze
{soften a manifestation of an acute LRI
inchildhood whether or nota child has
asthma, separation of the effects of asth-
in and othe: aa respiratory ness
(Gnfectons) on level and growth of lung
function in children is complicated. Ashe
‘ma or bronchial responsiveness may al-
terlevel and change in level of lung func-
tion or predispose to increased severity
Of LRI, and may account fo the aioci-
ation of LRI with alterations in lung
function development. Severe infection
{in early childhood may, on the othet
hand, alter the course of asthma or pre-
dispose towards bronchial sponsvenest
and its subsequent effects on lung
function.

‘As art ofa longitudinal, population-
based study of ealylfe risk predictors
for chronic obstructive ling disease in
‘dul life, the relationship berween lung
function and several measures of acute
LRI in childhood was invexigated. The
results suggest that in the population
studied, only the more severe acute LRI,
particularly those requiring hospitaliza:
tion, may be associated independently
with subsequent lover level and slower
srowth of lung function in children
