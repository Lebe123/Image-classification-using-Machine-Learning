Effect of Human a-Thrombin on the Transforming

Human «a2-Macroglobulin

‘Thrombin plays aceniral role in hemostasis by func:
oning in coagulation and platelet activation.” In add
on. e-thrombin mediates numerous biologic tespoinses,
including wound repatt. nflammavon. and bone resorp-
tion.""* Many’ of these activities result from ov thrombin =
association with specific cellular receptors. A thrombsn
receptor mediating cellular growth and platelet a ”
was recently cloned and sequenced.* The structure of the
thrombin receptor inclodes 9 substrate site for the prote
olyne acuity of a-thrombin and a noncovatent binding
site that interacts sith the a-thrombin anion exosite "|

“The acusity of FGF B31 depends on association wath,

this eviokine to cellular TGF-B receptors might alter the
