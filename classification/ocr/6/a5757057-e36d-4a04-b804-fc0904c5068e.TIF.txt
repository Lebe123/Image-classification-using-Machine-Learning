Cell renewal in the epithelium of the various levels of the respiratory tract does
not occur at a uniform rate (Bertalanffy, 1968), instead it varies, even between
cranial and caudal regions of the trachea (Bolduc & Reid, 1976). Several studies
hhave investigated the mitotic activity in the rat trachea, bronchi, bronchioles and
alveoli (Rertalanffy & LeBiond, 1953; Spencer & Shorter, 1962; Bertalanfty, 1964;
Shorter, Titus & Divert, 1964: Shorter, Titus & Divertie, 1966; Blenkinsopp, 1967;
Wells, 1970). However, no studies of mitotic activity of rat largyngeal epithelium
hhave been traced.

The larynx, in comparison with other regions of the respiratory tract, contains
five distinct ‘epithelial types identifiable by electron microscopy: squamous,
squamoid, respiratory and two cuboidal forms (Lewis & Prentice, 1980; Lewis,
1980),

‘The present study briefly describes the histological appearances of the various
epithelial types from one micron sections and reports their mitotic indices in det

 

 

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Forty male, specific pathiogen-free CFHB Wistar-derived, albino rats (average
weight 200) were obtained from Anglia Laboratory Animals, Huntingdon,
Cambridgeshire. Immediately on arrival five rats were killed and the lungs, trachea
and larynges examined histologically to assess the degree of chronic inflammatory
cell infiltration, and therefore the suitability of the rats for experimentation. The
remaining rats were maintained under strict barriered conditions for a 2 weeks
acclimatization period, after which time four rats were given intraperitoneal
injections of 0:1 mg per 190 g body weight of colchicine (Sigma Chemical Co.,
London) in sterile isotonic saline, The injections commenced at 10.00 am and
successive animals were dosed at intervals of five minutes. Exactly 4 hours after the
injection each rat was killed by an: intraperitoneal injection of sodium. pento-
barbitone. In addition, one rat was given an intraperitoneal injection of isotonic
saline as a vehicle control.

This experiment with: four colchicine and one control rat was subsequently:
repeated on six occasions.

‘The tongue, pharynx, larynx and trachea were removed. en masse and the larynx
carefully dissected free, and fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde in 0-1 m cacodylate butfer,
pH 73, at 4°C, for 3 hours. The larynges were then cut transversely into = 1 mm
rings, washed in buffer and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide. After dehydration
jn ascending concentrations of alcohol the rings were embedded in Epon. Three,
