Introduction

Immnoeytochemisty on ukrathin (290 nm) and semithin (205
in) xyusctons has been 2 powerful rechnigue for the hi

Tution localization of various cellular ancigens. During our study
ton the composition of ntacelllar granule ia human neutrophil,
wee have found that oe ofthe wont routine steps associated with
the preparation of .3-um and ultra-thin cyosectons hada pro-
Found effec on the outcome ofthese experiments. We found that
the composition ofthe medium employed to tansfer sections fom
the cutting surface in the cryomicrorome to EM grids or glass cov
