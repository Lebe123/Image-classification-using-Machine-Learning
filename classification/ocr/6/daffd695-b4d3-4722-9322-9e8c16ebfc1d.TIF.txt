ABSTRACT Cultures of human diploid fibroblasts (HDF) exhibiting density

dependent inhibition of replication (DDIR) resumed thelr progression through the
cell cycle following medium replacement and, after a lag period of two hours,
showed a dramatic increase in the incidence of isonucleolinar* cells and in the
levels of uptake of *H-uridine into the nucleoli. Between five and ten hours after
refeeding these nucleolar changes wore maximal, leveling off at the highest val-
ues, in periods corresponding to late G1 and ealy §. Concomitantly, a parallel
‘merease in the number of nucleolin per cell occurred, As cells progressed through
8 and G2 phases the nucleolin! decreased in nimber and reverted to the aniso-
‘nucleolinar type. The intensity of nucleolar labeling by “H-uridine and lts corre.
Inte, the frequency of cells with labeled nucleoli, also decreased ducing these cell
ceyele stages. Both pre- and postreplicative periods of mitotic quiescence were
characterized by high levels of anisonucleolinosis (60-80% of the cells) and by
very low levels of nucleolar +H-uridine incorporation,

‘The magnitude of these nucleolar changes occurring during G1 stage was
found (o be strongly dependent on: (1) the length of time of contact between the
cells and the fresh medium, at least eight hours of contact being necessary for
‘maximal response; (2) the amount of serum in the medium, the optimal serum
concentration being between 10 and $0%, and (3) the pH of the medium. The
nucleolar response was completely abolished at pH values below 7.0, These nucle.
lar changes were very sensitive t the presence of cycloheximide (10 nglml)
fand actinomycin D (0.003 gil), The behavior of the nucleoli in response to
these parameters was similar t the activation response of the cells to inidate
DNA synthesis.

During the time period of maximal nucleolar “activation” the onset of DNA
‘synthesis as well a3 the morphological and autoradiographic manifestations of
the nucleolar activation were completely inhibited by vary low levels of actino-
‘myein D (Ellem and Mironescu, "72, a selective inhibitor of nucleolar RNA syn.
thests (Perzy, 65). This suggested a possible role of nucleolar metabolism, in nor
‘mal diploid cells, inthe initiation of DNA synthesis. Our results, however, seera
to indicate that the nucleolar changes are necessary but not suifcient for the
‘subsequent initiation of DNA synthesis, since with graded serum concentrations
‘or medium volumes, smaller levels of a stimulus were needed to produce maximal
-isonucleolinosis than to effect a maximum replicative response in the celle.

 

 

 

Recent results indicate that, in the ab-
sence of any medium change, replication of
some human (Rhode and Ellem, ’68) or ro-
dent (Todaro et al.,'65) cell lines on a solid
substrate in vitro’ ccases when a critical
cellular density is, reached (density de-
‘pendent inhibition of replication — DDIR).
Celis can be roleased from DDIR by the
addition of fresh medium or by addition of
certain small molecular woight nutrients

to the depleted medium (Smets, "71; Ellem
and Mironescu, '73). Usually, in cells ex-
hibiting DDIR, synthesis of ribosomal RNA
(Levine et al., "65; Rhode and Ellem, '68)
4s greatly reduced or virtually ceases, and
the cells are blocked at the GI level (Nil-
hausen and Green, '65), Addition of fresh
complete medium (Rhode and Ellem, '68)
