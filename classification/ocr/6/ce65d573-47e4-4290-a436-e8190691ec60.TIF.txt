Germline Cy transcripts initiate from a non-coding | exon and terminate downstream of the
associated C, exons. 1g heavy chain class switch recombination from the VDJ~C, gene to
particular downstream C,, genes appears to be regulated by a process that involves mitogen and/or
eytokine induction of germline C;, transcripts from the downstream genes. We have examined the
expression of germline C, transcripts (,-C, transcripts) in splenic B cells and pre-B cell lines
after cytokine and mitogen stimulation. In contrast to the expression of the germline transcripts
from downstream C, genes, expression of germline C, transcripts was constitutive and unaffected
by mitogen and cytokine treatment. After a primary switch recombination event, the germline |,
promoter, which is now associated with a downstream C, gene, continues to be active—leading
to the generation of a novel germline transcript consisting of the I, exon spliced to the Cy exons
of the switched C, gene. We discuss the potential role of the expression of hybrid |,-containing
transcripts in the class switch process. We also describe a novel and sensitive assay, based on

 

    

the detection of the hybrid L-containing transcripts, that allows detection of class switch

 

Introduction

During 8 cell devetopment, the antigon binding domain of the
ig molecule sintialy associated wih the «and 6 constant region
genes allowing the Ig 0 be expressed as an IgM oF IgD protein
B calls have the potential to change the effector function of
ther ig molecules by undergoing a recombination event, termed
Ig heavy chain class switching (reviewed in 1-3). Class switch
recombination occurs between repettve sequences caled
simteh regions (S regions) located 5 to all of the Cy, genes
(except 3). Evidence suggests that class switching usually
involves recombination between the S region of C, and that
of a downstream C, gene and subsequent deletion of the
intervening sequences (4 - 6). Once B cells have undergone a
primary swtch recombination, they have the potential to undergo
adaitional itching events to one ofthe remaining downstream
C.. genes (7-16)
