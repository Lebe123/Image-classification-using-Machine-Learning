SUMMARY: Nuclear pool(s) of protein kinase C (PKC) may be a common
target for hormones and growth factors which affect the trophic state of
celis. ‘The data presented demonstrate a time and dose-dependent activation
of nuclear PKC by the HIV coat protein, gpl20, in isolated nuclei from rat
spleen and hippocampus. This gpl20-stimilated PKC response was blocked
‘by specific PKC inhibitors, a monoclonal antibody to PKC, and a monoclonal
antibody directed against the murine T¢ snslog, L3T4. Tt is suggested that
the gpl20 interaction with the nuclear trophic factor-PKC system may impair

' normal gene expression, and thus result in the clinical symptoms associated

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is considered to be the causative
agent in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and the viral envelope
protein, gpl20, is thought to facilitate viral entry into cells by binding to
the surface antigen, T4 (CD4). The T4 antigen has been localized to both
lymphocytes and the hippocampus in the brain (1,2). It has been suggested
that the pathology associated with HIV is not a direct consequence of viral
infection, but rather a result of interaction of gpi20 with T4 receptor sites
(34), Interestingly, there is considerable sequence homology between
‘vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and gpi20, (1,2,5) and it has been
proposed that VIP and gp120 compete for the same T4 binding sit

+ (1,2,5,6). Receptors for VIP have been localized to the plasma membrane of
lymphocytes (7) and areas within the hippocampus (8), both of which are
impaired in AIDS patients.

Substantial literature now demonstrates both the presence of receptors
for VIP (9) and the enzyme protein kinase C (PKC) in nuclei from a variety
of tissues (10-15). ‘The nuclear localization of PKC has been substantiated
both immunochemically and biochemically (16,17) and this nuclear poot
displays a higher calcium requirement for optimal activation. We have
