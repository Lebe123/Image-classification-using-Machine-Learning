ApsTract: We have used a combination of physical and motecular biological techniques to examine the
structure of Leptomonas collosoma spliced leader RNA. We confirm the general features of the previously
proposed structure for the 3’ half of the RNA, in which a single-stranded region is flanked by two stem
loops. However, we find that the 5’ half of the RNA, which contains the spice site, has two competing
secondary structures which differ only slightly in stability and which can interconvert on a fast (<1 s) time
scale, In the favored conformation, a stable hairpin helix is augmented by conserved complementarity
between the splice site and the S’end ofthe SL RNA. This putative helix has anomalous nuclease sensitivity
and thermal stability features, suggesting that itis probably coupled by unknown tert

other nucleotides in the 5? half-molecule, The structure offers intriguing parallels with RNA-RNA.

interactions in the mammalian splicing system.

Pre-mRNA splicing sa processby which anintron sexcised
and the exons are then ligated [reviews: Padgett etal. (1986);
Maniatis and Reed (1987)]; intermediates in the cs splicing
reaction have been well characterized. The trans splicing
reaction of trypanosomes and nematod
involves the transfer of a 5’ exon (22-41 nuclot
froma short (<200 nucleotide) spliced leader transcript onto
4 preexisting mRNA (Konarska etal, 1985; Murphy eta,
1986; Sutton & Boothroyd, 1986). In trypanosomes all of
themature mRNAs contain the spliced leader at their ends.
A trans spliced leader is also found in a small pereentage of
nematode mRNAs (Kraus & Hirsh, 1987; Blumenthal &
‘Thomas, 1988).

‘The proposed secondary structure for the kinetoplastid
spliced leader (SL) RNAS (Bruzik et al, 1988) was based
upon relative free energies predicted by the Fold program
(Zuker, 1989) and upon conservation ofthe folding pattern
for several SL RNAs. This structural conservation among
the trypanosomatid SL RNAs is striking due tothe lack of
length and sequence homology ouside ofthe spliced leader
exon portion of the molecule, The proposed secondary
structure contains three stem loops, the second and third of
which flank a single-stranded region which has the sequence
ofa binding ste for Sm proteins (Mattaj, 1988). The latter
arecommon splicing proteins that areimmunoprecipitable by
antibodies found in the serum of certain autoimmune patients
(Lemer & Stcitz, 1979). In vitro assembly of SL RNA
snRNPs with HeLa cell Sm proteins, followed by immuno-
precipitation with anti-Sm antibodies (Bruzik eta, 1988),
shows that the putative Sm protein binding site of the SL
RNAsisactiveinproteia binding. U! independenceof splicing
the trans spliced leader to an adenovirus exon in cis has also
been demonstrated using Ul-depleted HeLa cell extracts
(Bruzik & Steitz, 1990). This result led to the proposal that
{he functional domain for 5 splice site identification in trans
splicing resides in the SL sa RNP itself and not ina UI RNA
sa RNP.

Ourstrategy for investigating the structure of the SL RNA.
begins with tests ofthe global features of the proposed model
(Bruzik et al, 1988), primarily by determining the stability
and binding kinetics of DNA oligonucleotides hybridized to
the putatively single-stranded regions which ae predicted by
the model. This approach yielded the predicted results for
the 3 but not the 5’ half of the molecule. We also examined
the thermal unfolding equilibria and kinetics for the molecule,
‘using the temperature-jump (T-jump) technique, in which
‘thesampleis rapidly heated and the optical changeis measured
asa function of time. We found a low-temperature thermal
transition which could not be accounted for by unfolding of
Ihelies in the model of Bruzik et al. (1988), Subsequent
experiments localized this effect to the 5’half of the molecule.
We then employed mutagenesis and polyacrylamide gel
clectrophoresis methods such as ribonuclease mapping (Douth-
waite & Garrett, 1981; Celander & Cech, 1990) and base
rmodification/interference experiments (Peattie, 1979; Conway
& Wickens, 1989; Weeks et al., 1990) to probe the structure
ofthe S‘halfof LeptomonascollosomaSLRNA. We propose
anew structure in which a stable hairpin helix is augumented
by pairing of the 5’ end of the SL RNA with the spice site.
‘The hairpin helix has a measured Ty about 6 °C higher than
the analogous helix proposed by Broziketal. (1988). However,
the putative splice site helix bas unusual properties, including
‘anomalously small thermal stability changes upon mutation,
single-strand nuclease sensitivity a the splicesite,and apparent
tertiary interactions with additional nucteotides in the 5" half
of the SLRNA. We speculate that the internal spice site
pairing may be analogous to pairing ofthe 5’ end of Ul with
the 5’ splice site in mammalian pre-mRNA splicing (Zhuang
& Weiner, 1986),
