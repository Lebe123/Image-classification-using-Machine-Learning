INTRODUCTION

‘One of the most devastating complications
of cancer is the uncontrollable weight loss and
energy wasting (“the cachexia of malignancy")
which plagues the tumor host (1, 2}. Numer-
‘ous mechanisms (2, 3] have been proposed,
including anorexia and malabsorption (both
tumor-related and iatrogenic), and derange-
ments of host metabolism. Modern methods
of hyperalimentation have not succeeded in
reversing cancer cachexia despite the achieve-
ment of high parenteral caloric intake [4],
leaving one to conclude that altered host me-
tabolism is important in the pathogenesis of
this malnourished state.

Lipid metabolism in the experimental tu-
mor-bearing host undergoes several changes
which are reversible by tumor removal (5-7]
and which are quite different than those ac-

‘companying starvation or sensi alone (8). The
isappearance of retroperitoneal fat stores,
coupled with the concomitant development
of hyperlipidemia, and the reversal of these
abnormalities after tumor excision (5, 6],
prompted us to search for a tumor-associated
lipolysis-promoting “factor” in our animal
models.

‘Using an in vitro bioassay of lipolysis (de-
setibed in this paper), elevated lipolysis-pro-
‘moting activities and glycerol concentrations
‘were found in the serum of sarcoma-bearing,
‘ats (7] and in culture medium conditioned
by sarcoma cells Tumor removal resulted in
‘normalization of serum lipolytic activity and
lycerol concentration, and restoration of lost
body weight {7}.

‘The purpose of this study was to determine
whether human tumor cell fines also demon-
