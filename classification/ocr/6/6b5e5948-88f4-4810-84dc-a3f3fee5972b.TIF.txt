INTRODUCTION

Tt has been shown that, during smoking, compounds
"ath beling points as high as 317° C are not held
Imeverubly by the cigarete filter. Previous work in
‘ut laboratory indicated that phen cote, sobutyrie
teid,s-pentanone, ethanol, dodecane, tedecan, tea-
decane, pentdecane, hexadecane and octadceane added
to 4 callose acetate Stee vaporized from the fibers
uring. smoking of the cigarette. These compounds
‘exaped from the filter by entrapment in nontered
‘serosal particles (3). The awthod asad to investigate
this phenomenon was to add a Ciabeled compound
to a ler, smoke the cigarettes, and measure the
amount of Ctlabeled compounds that escaped from
the iter (3). Tis method does not accurately simulate
lation conditions since the Cisbeled compounds
were not filtered from cigarette smoke but were added
to the Biter before the cigarette was smoked. The
Purposes of this work were to develop a tediique
that re closely simulates conditions that occur during
Aitraton of cigarette smoke than the previo predate
Aid) and to utize this new tedique to. measure:
1 the amounts of nicotine and total pariclate matter
(TPM) that ae captured by « Bler for at least the
duration of 2 pat . the amounts of captured sicotine
and TPM that are eluted from a flter by subsequent
lle of amoke, and 3. the amounts of nicotine and
‘TPM that are trapped on the tobacco behind the
bbuming zone. The technique developed in this work
tiled. ler cigarettes constructed from tbuco
treated with Cltlabeled nicotine or CH candomly
labeled tobacco, The smoking of these cgaretes in-
‘woduced 4 small amount of the Ci labeled nicotine
(oF ClLabeled TPM into the smoke steam iounediately
‘behind the burning zane; subsequently, some of the
labeled components in the smoke wece filtered by the
cclllose acetate filter. A second Alter cigaretie wat
onstrated from this filter (containing the Cilabeled
TPM ce nicotine) and 2 regular tobaco column. TNs
finer ‘cigarette was smoked and the quanllty of

 

 

 

previously ftered C'Usbeled nicotine or Ci labeled
"TPM whid esaped from the fer was measured.
‘The escape of filtered “semi-volatie” (SV) compoonds
fom a cigarette filer is not a simple vaporization
pPhesomenon (4) When cigarette smoke passes through
2 ier, the escape of previously tapped SV compounds
from the fier is appreciable. When ai Us passed
‘through after containing SV compound) there is
only 4 slight lose of SV compounds from the filter
‘Thus, the passage of simoke aerosol partic through

fier is necesary before an appreciable amount of
fered SV smoke compounds can escape from a fer
Some of the processes which probably occur within
2 fer as cgarette smoke passes through it are pre=
tented schematically in Fig. + (not drawn to seal)
‘An SV compound which has been filtered can vaporize
to some extent from the Biber (A) or from an serosal
pattie (B) and condense ether on another fiber (C)
f¢ on another aerosol parte (0). The SV compound
that condenses on an aerosol particle vaporizes from
the particle (E), is removed by fttation as part of a
filtered particle (B, or escapes Sltaion as part of
nonfltered particle (G). Theve process may occur &
rember of tines before the SV compound escapes
from the flter. This overall proces of = éltered SV
compound excaping from a fber by entrspment in
fonitered aerosol particles as they passthrough the
‘ler has been designated “elution”
