Hypoxia and hypercapnia impose circulatory and
metabolic stresses on the body. Responses to these
sresses include both local and reflex mechanisms that
attempt to restore homeostasis and maintain perfusion
of the most vital and sensitive organs, such as the brain
and the heart. Increased ventilation, which is a reflex
response, aims to restore normoxia and/or normocap-
nia. Both hypoxia and hypercapnia also exert local
vasodilatory effects. Chemorefiex-mediated sympa
thetic vasoconstriction acts in opposition to the local
vasodilatory effects, except in the cerebral and coro-
nary circulations. Thus, the integrated response con-
sists of hyperventilation, peripheral vasoconstriction
and cerebral and coronary vasodilation. This inte-
grated response is further influenced by other factors,
including ventilation itself, interactions between hyp-
xia and hypercapnia, the severity of hypoxia and oth-
erreflexes, such asthe arterial baroreflexes. This review
will examine the role of the chemoreflexes in the re-
sponses to hypoxia and hypercapnia, interactions that
significantly modulate the chemoreflex responses and
the importance of the chemoreflexes in mediating the
cardiovascular responses to sleep apnea.

(CHEMOREFLEX RESPONSES TO
HYPOXIA AND HYPERCAPNIA

Hypoxia, by stimulation of the peripheral chemo-
receptors in the carotid bodies (1,2), results ini
creased minute ventilation, increased sympathetic ac-
tivation to peripheral blood vesselsand increased vagal
discharge to the heart (3). Other reflex responses to
peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation include choli

ergic vasodilation of coronary blood vessels (4) and
noncholinergic vasodilation of cutaneous blood vessels

  

 

 

(5) Peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation does not ap-
pear to affect cerebral blood vessels, which vasodilate
due 10 the local effects of hypoxia (6,7). In humans,
‘evidence that the peripheral chemoreceptors ate the
primary mediators of the reflex responses to hypoxia
are based on data showing that carotid body cener-
vation and resection result in an elimination of the
ventilatory response to hypoxia, At very tow levels of
oxygen tension, however (PO, < 40 mm Hg), hypoxia
elicits a central pressor reflex resulting in increases in
systemic arterial pressure (8-10). Furthermore, at ex-
tremely low levels of oxygen tension, failure of vaso-
motor regulatory control may result in widespread cir-
culatory collapse.

Hypercapnia acts via central chemoreceptors (11).
Which are thought to lic on the ventrolateral surface
of the medulla, and also results in sympathetic acti-
vation to peripheral blood vessels and increased ven-
tilation. About 12% of the ventilatory response to hy-
percapnia arises from stimulation of peripheral
chemoreceptors (12), Furthermore, hypercapnia and
acidosis potentiate the peripheral chemoreflex re-
sponses to hypoxia (13-16)

 

  
 

(CHEMOREFLEX INTERACTIONS,
With ventilation

Both hypoxia and hypercapnia elicit reflex increases
in minute ventilation. This increased ventilation ap-
pears to be the predominant response and acts to in
hibit the reflex sympathetic responses to hypoxia and
hypercapnia (15,16) and the reflex vagal response to
hypoxia (17,18).
