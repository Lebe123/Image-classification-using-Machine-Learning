‘The complexity of tobacco and tobacco smoke has
intrigued the chemists for the past several decades, In
recent years a number of papers dealing with the
fractionation of cigarette smoke condensate (CSC)
into scidie, basic and neutral fractions end the tu-

 

morigente activity in animals of these erude fractions
hhave been reported in the literature (5, 7). The poly~
nuclear aromatic hydrocarbons and the weekly actdle
phenolic fractions have exhibited tumor-initiating and
fumor-promoting characteristies respectively. ‘These
studies have been earried out with commercially avail.
fable cigarettes, ‘The use of different commercial
brands, or even one particular brand employed over a
period of time, az x source of the smoke condensate
sample makes it very dificult to correlate the results
obtained by different laboratories because of the vari-
‘ition in the composition of the blended tobacco and
the additives used in making the cigarettes.

"The University of Kentucky Reference (IR1) and
the alkaloid sevies cigarettes which were developed to
fil the need for standard cigarettes with known smoke
composition ean serve ag reference standards for both
ehemical and biomedical research. In this paper we
report the results of fractionation of the smoke con

Aensate samples from the University of Kentucky
Reference (IR1) and the low nicotine containing 1AL
cigarettes following the procedure of Swain and
‘coworkers (6), and the chemical analyses for nicotine,
benzo(a)perene and phenol content in the basie,
neutral, and weakly ‘acidic fractions, respectively.
‘When these reference cigarettes are used as common
standards, different laboratories can correlate their
results.

Production of Cigarette Smoke Condensate (CSC):

‘The reference cigarettes which were purchased from
the University of Kentucky, were smoked on a large
automatic cigarette smoking machine built for the
National Cancer Institute by the Process and Instru-
ments Corporation, New York. This machine which
Emokes approximately 2,000 cigarettes per hour, em-
loys a vacuum pump as the source of the puff volume.
‘The cigarettes are placed in 860 holders in four rows
around a eslinder which completes one turn in about
iO minutes, During this turn, each cigarette passes the
openings of fen smoking arms. The machine is de~
Signed to take a 35 ml pull of two seconds duration
fnce per minute, It ean be get to take 5 to 10. pulfs per
cigarette before the elgarette butt is ejected from the
machine by air pressure; the receptacle ig automat
tally refilled before the next smoking arm is reached.

"The smoke condensate was collected in four thre
liter Rasks connected in sories. The traps were cool
in a dry lee-Isopropanol bath. The frst two traps were
partially packed with Pyrex beads of dmm diameter
fnd the last two traps were packed with Teflon fla-
ment, This arrangement has been found highly satis-
factory for large seale collection of the smoke conden-
sate, The data from Table 1 indicate that the efficfen-
fy of the trapping system is greater than 90% when
the results are compared with those reported in the
Hiterature (1).
