{In Japan, lung cancer was the second leading cause of
cancer deaths for males and females in 1987." In males.

although smoking rates have been decreasing gradu
ally since the 1970s, 61% of males smoked in 1988.

‘which is considerably higher than in other developed
countries. In females. however. smoking rates have
been quite constant since the 1950s—only 13% of
females smoked in 1988. whichis low for a developed
country. As a result. population attributable risks for
lung cancer caused by smoking were estimated at 71%

in males but only 26% in females.

Inthe standard mortality ratio (SMR) analysis of the
‘geographical distribution of lung cancer risks. a higher
SMR sas observed in coastal urban areas than in
inland rural areas for males, but for females no such
tendency was observed.’ This indicates that occupa
tional exposure and outdoor air pollution seem to have
liule influence as lung cancer risks for Japanese
women. Therefore. it is necessary to investigate nsk
factors for females which might be related to daily
lifestyle

This study aims to clarify the risks of lung cancer
‘caused by indoor air pollution among nonsmoking
females by means of & hospital-based case-control
study.

This work is part of a joint project of the research
group for lung cancer prevention in Osaka. The mem-

According to Osaka Cancer Registry. 2481 primary
lung cancer 1977 males and $04 females) patients were
diagnosed in Osaka Prefecture in !98S. Of these about
‘one-quarter were registered from the top eveht hospi
tals, which have special departments for lung cancer.
These eight hospitals participated in a mulu-centre
hospitalsbased case-control study with the support ot
the Osaka Anti-Lung Cancer Association,

Both cases and controls were collected from those
newly admitted to the eight hospitals from 1 January
1986 0 31 December 1988, and their ages ranged from
4010 79 years at the time of hospitalization.

‘Of the above eight hospitals. all wards for tung
cancet and one of two wards for other diseases were
involved in this study. All newly-admitted patients
both males and females. in these wards were investi-
{gated by a self-administered questionnaire atthe time
of admission to the hospital. A uniform questionnaire
‘was used in all hospitals. designed specifically for this
study. which included questions about smoking habs
exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and
‘exposure (© possible indoor air pollution. A total of
1079 lung cancer patients and 1369 patients of other
diseases were investigated for males. and 295 lung
