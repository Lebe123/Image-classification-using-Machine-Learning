‘Cancer Mortality inthe United States: 1950-1977 (Na-
tional Cancerinsinute Monograph, No. $9), edited by
Frank W. Mckay, Margot R. Hanson, and Robert W.
‘Mills, 475 pp, with lls, $18, Bethesda, Maryland:
National Cancer Institue, 1982

This 59h volume in a distinguished series of cancer
‘monographs gives fundamental, complete, and clear
‘exposionsof many aspects of the cancer situation inthe
United States. tn 330 pages, the book considers deaths
and death rates de to cancer of 35 sites, together with
Hodgkins disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoms, multiple
myeloma, and all ypes of leukemia, For each of these
‘categories, data are presented separatelyfor white males,

white females, nonwhite males, and nonwhite females.
‘Age-adusted monslity rates are shown forthese four ace
and sex groups from 1950 through 1977 With the time
‘span divided int four 7-year intervals, age-specific ates
{are shown which indicate he trend over ime by age for
‘each ne our ace and sex groups. The waphs indicate
the rates along the verveal axis and elher age of time
slongile busizonal ais Bocaure only aifetic sales
‘are used. diferences are almost imposible to see on the
‘graphs when ates te low.Relatve dfferetcescannotbe
ascertained from te graphs, but tables provide the data

‘A departure from former publications is the intro-
_ductionofcomputer-produced tree-dimensional graphs
(eaths or rates by age by calendar year. These are
shown fr each ste for which suficient data exist to
‘warrant such detail. For example, the three-dimensional
_12phs are not shown for cancer of the larynx, but they
2g shown forcancerofthebronchus trachea, and lng.
‘The graphs ae distorted somewhat in oder to demon.
strate thethree dimensionality. The wendsthat one might
wish to study are, pethaps, determinable with careful
consideration; however, on the whole, these graphs are
aative but not very use. .

‘The sength ofthe publication lies mainly inthe ables
fom which detailed studies can be made. The two-
«dimensional gaphs ae sound except for he aforemen:
tioned weaknes of not showing comparisons adequately
forthe small rates.

‘The book is further strengthened by three appendices
‘that present detaled information. Appendix 1 shows
‘annual tumor mocality by detailed international Cause of
Death ICD) codes rom 1950 through 1977, The data are
lassie by Syearage groups and seem tobe complete,
‘They are dificult and frustrating to use, but the infor-
‘mation is there forthe readers who demand detail

“Append 2 gives a display ofthe varius revisions of
the ICD codes that ae used in ths volume. Revisions
numbered 6,7, and 8 are presented clearly and in detail

‘Appel 3 gives rise to doubt about te whole pro-
Jct. 1s eprimed from an ace inal published in
the American Journal of Public Heath in 1961, entitled
“Accuracy of Cancer Death Certificates and Rs Effect on
Cancer Mortality Statistics,” by Percy, Stanek, and
Gloecker. The importance ofthis article fe regard to this
volume may be very great. For example, the statements
‘made that "the underying cause of death 2s coded on
the death certicate, was found to be accurate for about
{65% of the cancer deaths in this study." Such 2 low
percentage of accuracy makes one wonder why this
volume was prepared at all, why more attention was
‘ot given tothe problem of accuracy Inthe basi tabu-
lations in the 330.page presentation. The stctements
