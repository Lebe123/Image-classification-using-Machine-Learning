SUMMARY

‘The ciliotoxicity of 316 individual compounds representative of the
gaseous and semivolatile phases of tobacco smoke has been investigated
sing chicken tracheal organ cultures, When examined at § mM concentre-
tion and measuring the time to complete eilostasis, 36% of the compounds
‘were found to cause ciliostasis within 16 min, while about 60% had no
visible effect on the ciliary activity during  60-min exposure. The majority
of the eilliotoxic compounds were either alkylated phenylethers, benzoni

tiles, benzaldehydes, phenols, benzenes, naphthalenes and indoles, of @,8-un-
saturated ketones and aldehydes or C,—Cie alipbatic alcohols, aldehydes,
scids and nitriles. Most of the compounds classified as benzoic acids, esters,
polyaromatic hydrocarbons, amines and Nheterocycles, except indoles,
were found to be inactive.

 

wrropucTion

‘The importance of an intact “mucociliary escalator" for the clearance of
the respiratory tract is well documented [1,2]. Since inhibition of the ciliary
activity reduces the clearance capacity, which allows airbome particles to
remain in the airppassages and increases the risk of acute and chronic dam-
‘ages, further knowledge about the inhibitory effects of individual organic
compounds is of considerable interest
