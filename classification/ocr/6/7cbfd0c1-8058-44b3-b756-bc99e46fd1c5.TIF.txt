TTLP bonding is @ new process now in production which
economically produces high strength diffusion bonds in
heat resistant materials without the need to apply sub-
stantial pressure during bonding. The process uses a
mating surface interiayer alloy which temporarily melts
and then resolidfies at the bond temperature to form @
joint whose characteristics resemble those of 2 solid

Introduction

Nickel base superalloys are used extensively in gas
turbine engines because of the severe high temper-
ature, long time operating environment. ‘Significant
‘cost reductions and performance advantages can tre-
‘quently be achieved by employing metal joining pro-

cesses in the manufacture of these superalloy gaé tur-
bine components. Unfortunately, the limited wel
ability of most superalloys (Ref. 1) has restricted the
application of fusion techniques on structural turbine
hardware. Brazing is often utilized to join these ma-
terials and thus avoid fusion cracking problems. How-
ever, there are many applications for which superalloy
brazements do not possess adequate elevated temper-
‘ature mechanical or physical properties.

‘Another method which has shown promise for join-
ing superalloys is solid state diffusion bonding. Al-
though these materials are more difficult to join by
process than some other alloy families (e.g. titanium,
iron), methods have been developed for producing ex-
cellent solid state diffusion bonds in both precipitation
strengthened Ref. 2) and dispersion strengthened (Ret.
3) nickel alloys. This approach is attractive for some
component shapes, but the need for high bonding pres-
sures (e.g, 500-000 psi), exacting mating surface
preparation and fit-up, and some deformation in the
parts during bonding can make the process uneconom-
ical in many situations. Also, when fabricating parts of
‘complex geometries, it may be impossible to apply
bonding pressure uniformly to the mating surfaces
‘even with expensive and elaborate tooling.

‘Anew process (Ref. 4) has recently been developed
to alleviate these difficulties and permit the diffusion
bonding of nickel base superalloys without the need for
substantial bonding pressure. With this process, called
‘TLP bonding, bonds with strengths equivalent to base
‘metal values can be achieved in a variety of similar and
dissimilar alloy combinations. Complex shaped paris
can be joined using simple tooling and mating surface
preparation. Also, bonding is conducted in conven:
tional vacuum or argon heat treating furnaces to permit
large numbers of parts to be economically joined in
each process cycle.
