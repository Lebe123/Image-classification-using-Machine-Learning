Abstract
AA significant change in hepatic aldehyde dehydrogenase ac-
tivity as been observed in normal Sprague-Dawley rat liver
daring the promotion phase of hepatocarcinogenesis induced
by brief feeding of 2acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF) followed
by tumor promotion using dietary phenobarbital (PB) ex-
posure. Animals receiving only 2-AAF or PB do not possess
this new aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. The phenotype is
characterized by the appearance of a new cytosolic isozyme
Kinetcally, electrophoretically and _immumochemically
distinct from the normal liver aldehyde dehydrogenase iso-
zymes and from aldchyde dehydrogenases inducible in
2-AAP-induced hepatomas. The new isozyme is NAD-depen-
‘ent, dislfiram-senstive and cross-reacts with antiserum to a
normal liver aldehyde dehydrogenase inducible in several
lines of rats by PB. However, the population of animals used
inthis study has been shown previously to be non-responsive
to aldehyde dehydrogenase induction by dietary PB. Since no
animals receiving only PB express this new isozyme, the ar-
cinogen must play a significant role in its induction. More-
‘over, that not all animals receiving carcinogen and promoter
possess the phenotype suggests this carcinogea/promoterin-
{eraction has a genetic basis,

Introduction

Work in our laboratory is directed toward elucidating the
‘mechanisms underlying the expression of a unique aldehyde
dehydrogenase phenotype (aldehyde:NAD(P) oxidoreduc-
tase, E.C, 1.2.1.3 and 13.1.) in hepatomas induced in
‘Sprague-Dawley rats by 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF)*
(1~5). The phenotype is characterized by an increase in total
aldehyde dehydrogenase activity due to the appearance of
several cytosolic isozymes not present in normal live. The
tumor isozymes are very active with aromatic aldehyde
substrates and NADP as coenzyme and have electrophoretic
obits, isocletrie points and immunochemical properties,
distinct from those of normal liver aldehyde dehydrogenases,
(2-5). The tumor phenotype is not due to reexpression of
fetal aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (4). To date, we have
observed no significant changes in aldehyde dehydrogenase
activity in normal liver during 2-AAF-induced hepatocarcino-
genesis prior to the appearance of the tumor aldehyde de-
hydrogenase phenotype.

In normal rat liver, aldehyde dehydrogenase exists as at

least three isozymes found in mitochondrial and/or micro-
somal fractions (4,7). These isozymes can be differentiated on
the basis of substrate and coenzyme preference, substrate Kn,
immunochemical properties and sensitivity to inhibitors.

In addition to these basal isozymes, several aldehyde de-
hydrogenases can be induced by various xenobiotics in nor-
‘mal liver (@~14). Among these are two very effective pro-
rmoters of hepatocarcinogenesis, phenobarbital (PB) and
2,3,7,Stetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCCD). PB induoes a
‘gtosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase in certain genetically
defined lines and certain strains of rats (8—10,13). A second,
cytosolic isozyme is inducible by TCDD jin both PB-
responsive and non-responsive lines (11 — 13). Although the
tumor aldehyde dehydrogenase isozymes differ in a number
of properties from the TCDD- inducible isozyme, the TCDD-
inducible isozyme is immunochemically identical to at last
fone of the tumor isozymes (15). Neither the tumor nor
TCDD-inducible isozymes are related to the PB-inducible
isozyme (1,15).

Maximal induction of aldehyde dehydrogenase activity o°-
curs within 3 days of PB exposure and within 14 days follow-
ing TCDD exposure (8,11). In as much as some of the
hepatomas possessing the tumor aldehyde dehydrogenases
hhave been induced by a turor-induction protocol employing
PB as a promoter and at least one tumor isozyme and the
‘TCDD-induetble isozyme are immunochemicaly identical, it
‘was of interest to determine when the tumor aldehyde de-
hydrogenase phenotype is first detectable during the tumor-
{induction process. The results of such an experiment indicate
that the tumor aldehyde dehydrogenase phenotype is indeed
tumor-specific (6). It is not detectable in any grossly normal
liver during or following carcinogen exposure, even in
animals receiving PB as promoter. In the course of this work,
however, we did observe a significant change in the hepatic
aldehyde dehydrogenase phenotype of some individuals that
received 2-AAF followed by PB. The characterization and
significance of this change are reported here.
