“The WES rat cerebellar cell lin, which is Infected with a
Rous sarcoma virus that Is eemperature-sensitive for pp6Osre
{ransformation, shows temperature-dependent expression of
theneurat-celladhesion molecule (N-CAM) and gla ibrillary
Stiéle protein (GFAP). We found that WCS cells maintained
st the'non-permissive temperature In both monolayer cul-
tures and aperoie are subject c@ density dependent Ih
on'of growth, whereas cele mainealned at the permissive
femperttare continued ts arow. The maveren of Wolted
WCF calls at both temperatures was similar, while the migra
lon of WES celle out of dimensional aggregates was faster
Sethe nonpermissive temperature. We tested whether the
RSViinduced changer affect the invasion of the WCS cells in 2
Invitro assays: the chorlorallantoicmembrane assay and the
<hicksheart-tragment assay. In both assays, WCS cells grown
Sticlcher temperature were invasive. Theve results indicate
that growth rate Is unrelated to invasion and that loss of
N-cAMcmediated celkcell adhesion is not necessary for inva-

 

  

 

Malignant primary brain tumors are diffusely invasive and
usually result in death of the host without forming metastases
{Russell and. Rubenstein, 1977). Improvements in the teat
nent of such patients will require methods for earlier diagno.

foreover, the celivlar and molecular changes that confer the
ability to'detach from the primary tumor mass and invade
surrounding tissue have not been defined

Decreased cell-cell adhesion of tumor eclls was suggested (0
be a key element in detachment during invasion (Coman,
194d). For example, transformation of MDCK cells by Heras
reduces expression of the epithclial adhesion molecule B-cad:
herin/ovornonilin (Behrens ef al. 1989), ln this ease, reduc-
tion of adhesion does appeut to enhance the invasive ability of
the cells in 2 in vitro assays. Recently, the role of adhesion in
invasion by epithelial cells was underscored by the finding that
invasion of 2 de-differentiated human breast carcinoma cell
Tine was prevented by transfecting these cells with eDNAs for
Excadheain (Frixen ef al, 1991). Transformation of certain
neuronal and astrocyte-like cells by Rous sarcoma virus (RSV)

‘Simitarly, a glioma cell fine with increased mctasttic capacity
showed decreased N-CAM expression (Andersson et at
1991). Thus, changes in the expression or activity of cell-cell
tdhesion molecules may reflect functionally important pheno-
typic changes.

"To investigate the role of adhesive changes in, tumor-cell
invasion, we analyzed the invasion of a clonally-derived pe
manent cel Hine, WCS (Giots et al, 1980; Giotta and Cohn,
1981). which shows temperature-dependent expression of
N-CAM (Greenberg et al... 1984). N-CAM mediates ho:
rmophilic cell-cell adhesion (Rotishauser et al.. 1982). the
fore he temperature-dependent decrease in N-CAM caused by
R5V-transformation resus in a large reduction in the adhesion
fof WC cells to each other in vitro (Greenberg ef al. 1984). In
the present study, we analyzed the movement, growth proper
tics and N-CARE mediated adhesion of WCS cells grown at

39°C or 33°C and correlated these findings with their ability t0
invade, ‘These analyses revealed that WCS cells were invasive
regardless of their expression of differentiation markers, The
invasion of WCS cells is also unrelated t0 their growth chat-
fateristics. Furthermore, loss of N-CAM mediated cell cell ad-
hesion is not essential for invasion.
