‘though the effects of gases on the muco-

indicated that cigarette smoke interfered
with lung clearance of bacteria, presumably
also by incapacitating macrophages. Con-

‘Alveolar macrophages from albino rabbits of
Doth sexes were harvested by the procedure of
Myrvik et al except that the Iangs and heart
‘were not excised. ‘The trachea was transected
[Bnd the lung was washed with Hank's balanced
‘ult solution (BSS). ‘The longs were washed
tbrice with about 40 ml of BSS. Siliconized test
tubes were used throughout. Blood was taken
from the heart with a separate syringe to
obtain autologous serum used in the vital stain:

the BSS solution was made using crystal vi-
letacetic acid solution for staining and an
Ihemocytometer for counting. Approximately 20
