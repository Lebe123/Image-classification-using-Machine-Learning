ree-cleetron lasers are also characterized by unusually high
power and efficiency.

This article has attempted (0 treat a number of important
topics in sufficient detail so as to be meaningful to a wide
endership. It has not been possible to give a comprehensive
treatment of the subject of light, for a more detailed treat-
ment of both topics surveyed in this article and of the many
topics that were omitted, see the Bibliography.

Light Seattering
KR. W. Detenbeck

The scientific study of light scattering began in 1869 with
the experiments of Tyndall, who sent a beam of white light
through a suspension of fine particles. The scattered light
‘sas bluish and, observed at right angles to the beam, was,
hichly polarized. These effects suggested to Tyndall thatthe
‘Nue color and polarization of ight from the sky are produced
1m the scattering of sunlight by atmospheric dust. In a sub-
sequent, theoretical treatment Rayleigh calculated the scat-
‘ering from a random collection of small (compared with a
\savclength), widely separated spheres. He predicted the ob-
served polarization phenomena, as well as the inverse-
fourth-power dependence of scattered intensity on wave-
length which gives the sky its blue color. That the blue color
an4 Polarization were most striking in the clearest skies led

sleigh to conclude that the molecules of air itself, not
“led dust particles, are responsible for the blue sky.

Wavefronts propagate straightforward within a homoge-
‘ous medium, and the effect of the medium is described
{erm ofits average electromagnetic properties. Light se
‘ers when it passes through a medium that contains inho-

rogeneities on the scale of a wavelength, These may be
embedded particles as in Tyndall's scattering experiments,
‘or the molecules of the medium itself, as in Rayleigh’s theory
Of the blue sky, However, Rayleigh’s molecular theory ap-
plies only to gases, where itis proper to add the intensities
of light scattered by individual molecules. In condensed mat-
ter the medium is quite homogeneous on the scale of optical
‘wavelengths, and the coherent addition of scattered ampli-
tudes cancels radiation inal but the forward direction. Using
2 different model suggested by Smoluchowski, Einstein in
1910 described the weak light scattering from liquids in terms
of thermodynamic density fluctuations within small volume
elements of a continuous medium

Descriptions of light-scattering phenomena can be clas
sified as static or dynamic. Static descriptions include time-
averaged angular distributions of scattered intensity and po-
larization. One interesting case is the scattering of linearly
polarized light from a single particle, ilustrated in Fig. 1. IF
the scattering takes place within a surrounding medium of
index re, and the vacuum wavelength of the incident light
‘beam is Ao, the incident wave vector has magnitude ky =
2ranlhy. The scattered light has wavelength As, and the mag-
nitude of ts wave vector is ks = 2an/As. The incident beam
propagates in the direction of the vector ko, and the scattered
light travels from the particle to the detector inthe direction
of ks. The two wave vectors determine the scattering plane,
in which the scattering angle between them is denoted by 8.
Inacommon arrangement the incident light is polarized with
its electric field aligned along the normal to the scattering
plane, often called the vertical direction and denoted here
by the unit vector ey. The detector may select either the
vertically polarized component or the horizontal component,
with electric field aligned along ey.

Electromagnetic scattering from a particle remains an in-
teresting theoretical problem in itself. The exact solution for
the scattering from an isolated sphere was obtained by Mie
in 1908, but the only other exact solution fora finite particle,
an ellipsoid of revolution, awaited the work of Asano and
