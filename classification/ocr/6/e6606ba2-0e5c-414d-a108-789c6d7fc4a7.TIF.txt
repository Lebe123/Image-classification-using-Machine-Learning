Background. Few studies have reported the relationship between passive smoking (PS) in early ile and the risk of
lung cancer. This study was done fo evaluate the risk of female lung cancer trom PS. especially that duting Childhood

and adolescence,

Methods. Using household exposure to tobacco smoke as an estimate of PS, a 1:1/pated case-control study was,

‘conducted in Harbin, China. We interviewed 114 fer

male primary lung cancer cases, aged 30-69 years, and thei

hospital-based controls. The controls were non-cancer patients, elected from the same hospital as the cases, and

‘matched on age (+ § years), residential area and

‘smoking status over their iletime, There were 59 pairs who ever

‘smoked and §5 paits who never smoked. Information on PS was collected by residence for each ot the following

Conclusions. Household: PS, particularly that during childhood,
assessment of PS should be done by ditferent periods of exposure

There is increasing evidence suggesting that involuntary

\with respect to who are at higher risk: adults or children,
Some studies have noted the importance of exposure to
tobacco smoke in early life in relation to cancer risk in
adulthood," while others found no association for
non aoking women exposed to tobacco smoke during
childhood

In addition, the methods to estimate PS varied by
study. The estimate of PS from only the husband or the
Spouse, which has often been used, is in question.!!"!?

MATERIALS AND METHODS
‘The cases were female primary lung cancer patients who
were selected from the Harbin Cancer Registry. The
criteria for inclusion were: Resident of Harbin city, aged
30-69 years and diagnosed by histopathology during
January 1985 and November 1986. A total of 114 cases
were eligible and alliwere interviewed face-to-face. They
included $5 adenocarcinoma, 28 squamous cell carci
‘noma, 20 small cell and oat cell carcinoma, and 11 other
types. A reporting system was set up to-ensure quick
registration of cases, and immediate investigation,
