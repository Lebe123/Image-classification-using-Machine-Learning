SIDS—A Prospective Study

“The aim of this investigation was to dentty the sources of postnatal exposure to tobacco smoke at 1 month
cof age and to examine ther relation to eudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The Tasmanian Infant Health
Suney was a prospective conor study undertaken from 1988 to 1995. l invaved 9,828 infants (89% of ebpble
infants) at higher ak of SIDS. Subsequently 53 eigile ivants died of SIDS. Hospital interviews were available
fon 51 and home inerviews on 35 SIDS Infants. Urinary cotinine assays were conducted using gas-iquid
Chromatography (7 = 100). Within predictive model tat explained 63% of urinary cotinine variance, the
Strongest predetor of cotinina and also of SIOS was maternal emoking, though the effects of prenatal and
posinatal smoking could not be separated. However, for particular smoking-related behaviors, ere was

‘The incidence of sudden infant death syndrome
(SIDS) has fallen by approximately 50 percent in sev-
eral countries during the early 1990s following suc-
cessful campaigns 10 reduce the prevalence of prone
infant sleeping position (1). A large fraction of the
remaining SIDS deaths is occurring.

 

to identify preventable causes of these deaths
‘A leading contender is infant exposure to tobacco
smoke, either in utero or postnatally. The recent
Confidential Enquiry (Inquiry) into Stillbirths and
Deaths in Infancy (CESDN) study in the United
Kingdom is the first to provide data on factors associ-
ated with risk for SIDS in a population where preva
lence of prone sleeping position has fallen to very low
levels following the "Back to Sleep" campaign in 1991
