‘The previous generation of health
workers has documented the enormous
burden of disease and death that tobac-
co produces; itis the current gener:
tion’s task to apply this knowledge
reduce the morbidity and mortality
caused by tobacco in this country and
abroad. These four books provide use-
ful background material for the job
ahead.

The British journalist Peter Taylor
has produced a briskly written book
which summarizes the major scientific,
‘economic, and political realities of the
tobacco industry. The book begins with
‘an account of the scientific evidence
that cigarettes cause cancer, heart dis-
case, and emphysema and bronchitis,
He relates this with the story of how the
deta emerged in the major public
hncalth reports on smoking and with sev-
eral anecdotes about the tobacco indus-
try’s own research on the health effects
‘of smoking. Several examples of the in-
dustry’ denial in the face of clear evi-
dence are presented.

The next chapter summarizes the

 

 

 

major features of the great (largely
British and American) tobacco com-
panies. The origins and interconnec-
tions of the six largest multinational
firms are presented.

‘When Taylor discusses the mass me-
dia's habit of downplaying the relation-
ship of smoking and disease, he pro-
vides a valuable, behind the scenes ac-
count of his own 1976 documentary,
Death in the West. This film contrasts
the stories of six men from the Ameri-
‘ean West who developed major ciga-
rette-associated diseases with promo-
tons for Marlboro cigarettes and inter-
views with executives from Marlboro's
‘manufacturer, Philip Morris. The film
undercuts the seductive appeal of ciga~
rette advertising. Philip Morris suc-
ceeded in having the film removed from
cireulation in Great Britain, but copies
have recently become available again.
Death in the West has become part of
several innovative school-based tobacco
education programs,

‘The remainder of Taylor's book con-
tains sometimes over-long accounts of
the political maneuvering around ciga~
rettes and health in Great Britain and
the United Statesin recent years. These
case studies are nonetheless valuable:
the ability of the tobacco industry to
gain am-advantage in arena after arena
is impressive, and Taylor has docu-
mented many of the industry's tech-
nigues and approaches.

Elizabeth Whelan, a public health
worker, i also concerned with the so-
cial, political, and economic aspects of
the tobacco problem. She shares with
Taylor the conviction that active.
sition from the tobacco industry and its
supporters is the major reason that the
abundant scientific evidence of harm
from smoking has not yet led to effec-
tive control measures.

Whelan's book is organized into
three parts. The first three chapters
outline the evidenee that tobacco is a
major cause of disease and highlight 14
“ploys” that the tobacco industry has
Aeveloped in response to the medical

evidence. This analysis should be help-
ful to people whose major information
source on the subject has been the mass
media. All too often, a news story con-
{taining “bad” news about tobacco and
disease is “balanced” with distracting
and evasive comments from the Tobac-
co Institute.

‘The major portion of the book is de-
voted to an historical narrative about
the problem. This provides a useful
overview. For instance, cigarettes only
became widely available with the per-
fection of mass production machinery
in 1884, Mass production itself gener-
ated the need for mass promotion; ciga-
rette advertising has been an important
part of the industry for as long as cig
Tettes have been produced by machine.

Finally, the third portion of Whelan’s
book outlines a variety of actions and
activities that can help reduce tobecco
consumption. The prescription is broad
‘and unfocused, but this isthe state of
the art. What has been tried heretofore
has produced few results. Determining
the appropriate strategy and assem-

ing resources to implement it are the
major challenges now facing public
health. Whelan has summarized the
problem and hes provided a set of sug~
aestions. It is a beginning

“The books b jp and Richy
ard Kouri and by G. Mangan and J.
Golding stand in marked contrast io
those of Taylor and Whelan.

‘Henry and Kouri report the results of
investigations they conducted while un-
der contract tothe Council for Tobacco
Research—USA, Inc between 1975,
and_J983. The key experiments in-
‘volved exposing mice to cigarette
smoke for up to 110 weeks and observ-
ing whether neoplasia oceurred in the
tracheas or lungs of exposed animals to
‘a greater extent than in unexposed ani-
mals. A numberof ancillary studies are
also described. The main experiments
‘were burdened with parallel investiga
tions that sought to determine whether
cigarette smoke exposure was associat-
ed with the more rapid appearance of
