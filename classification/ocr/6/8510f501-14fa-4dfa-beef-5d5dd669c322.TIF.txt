the result of the direct action of the ion on a specific
receptor of the tissue, since the contraction elicited is
‘hot antagonized by agents which block the action of
acetylcholine. Excessive ingestion of the ion may pro-
duce an extreme contractile state throughout the entice
gastrointestinal tract, resulting in. symptoms such as
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and severe abdominal pain,
‘The cardiovascular effects may include a substantial rise
in blood pressure owing to a generalized basoconstrie-
tion, cardiac palpitation, and extrasystoles. In the later
stages of barium intoxication, convulsions followed by
paralysis of the extremities may be observed. Ingestion
of 1 Gm of a soluble salt may prove fatal, with death
resulting from cardiac. arrest. Hemorchages in the
gastrointestinal tract and pigmented granulation of the
‘enal tubules are often found in cases of barium poison-
ing.

Barium chloride isa soluble and extremely t
It was formerly used in Stokes-Adams disease;
its value in this condition is negligible, and its toxic
nature precludes therapeutic utilization, Other barium
salts, such as the sulfide and carbonate, should also be
avoided in therapeutics, since they ate partially solubi-
lized in the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in the ab-
sorption of the barium ion in potentially toxic quanti-
ties,

The treatment of barium poisoning consists princi-
pally of the oral! administration of a sodium or mag-
nesium sulfate solution, which precipitates the ion as the
insoluble barium sulfate and simultaneously serves as a
cathartic to evacuate the contents of the intestinal tract,
‘The cautious utilization of intravenously administered
calcium or magnesium salts may also be beneficial in
advanced cases. Morphine sulfate for pain and sodivin
amytal to counteract convulsions may also be indicated,
together with otfier supportive therapy.

Therapeutic. Uses. Barium sulfate is an insoluble
salt which manifests radiopaque properties and which,
fon oral ingestion, forms an adherent film over the
‘mucous linings. Tt is, therefore, used as a contrast
medium for x-ray visualization of the gastrointestinal
{tract and as an antidiarrheal agent in gastroenteritis.
Infrequently, granulomas of the rectum have been ob-
served with the use of an enema of barium sulfate for
oenigenographic contrast visualization, *

The soluble salts of barium should not be used in
therapeutics.
