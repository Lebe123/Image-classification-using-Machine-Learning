Introduction

Never smokers can be passively exposed to tobacco
‘smoke at work, at home, and in public areas such as
shopping centers and restaurants, particularly if the
ventilation is poor. Concern over the average never
smoker's lung cancer risk from exposure to “environ-
‘mental" tobacco smoke (ETS)has grown considerably
since a 1981 study reported an association between
ung cancer in nonsmokers and marriage to a smoker
Hirayama, 1981). Since then, other epidemiological
studies of the association between lung cancer among
nonsmokers and ETS exposure from living with
‘smoker have been conducted in Japan (Akiba ¢1 al.,
1986), Greece (Trichopoulos et al., 1963), Hong Kong
(Chan & Fung, 1982; Koo et al., 1985), Sweden (Per-
‘shagen et al., 1987), Great Britain (Gillis et al., 1984;
Lee et al., 1986), and the U.S. (Garfinkel et al., 1981;
Correa et al., 1983; Bufflere7 al., 1984; Kabat & Wyn-
der, 1984; Garfinkel e7 al., 1985; Dalager e1 al., 1986;
Brownson ef al., 1987; and Humble et al., 1987). The

  

 

 

“To whom sl correspondence should be addressed

 

results of these studies have been used to estimate an
average excess lung cancer risk for never smokers of
30% from ETS exposure (Blot & Fraumeni, 1986;
NRC, 1986; Wald et al., 1986; Wigle et al., 1987). Al-
termatively, the risk can be estimated by downward
‘extrapolation techniques based on the lung cancer risk
for current smokers and the average exposure of cur-
rent and never smokers. The former method is a risk-
‘based estimate whereas the latter is an exposure-based
estimate.

 

Linear Extrapolation
This study uses linear downward extrapolation to
‘estimate the lung cancer risk and the number of U.S.
Jung cancer deaths for male and female never smokers
in 1980 from exposure to ETS. The final estimate of
the number of ETS-attributable never smoker lung
‘cancer deaths requires four preliminary estimates:

1. The number of never smokers at risk,
2. The average tobacco smoke exposure of never
