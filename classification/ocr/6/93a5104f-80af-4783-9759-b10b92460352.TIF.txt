however, levels of expression of p/6 differed by up to

Conversely, he high levels of p26 expression were not the

Introduction

Deletions javolving chromosome bands 9pi3-23 have been
reported in at least 50% of non-small cell lung cancers
(NSCLC) (1,2) and subsequent deletion mapping hes
suggested the oxistence of at least three tumor suppressor
genes within thischromosome region 2). The eyclin-dependent
kinase (edk) inhibitor genes, p16 and p/S) were recently
Jdentified (3.4), and both mip to 9p2l. piS expression is
