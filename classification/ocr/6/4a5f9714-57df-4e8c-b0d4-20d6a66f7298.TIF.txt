‘Summary

We have devised agenetic strategy tolsolate the target
of acidie activation domains of transcriptional active
tors based on toxicity in yeast cells of the chimeric
‘activator, GALA-VP16. Toxlelty required the Integrity
‘of both the VP16 acidic activation domain and the
GALA DNA-binding domain, suggesting that Inhibition
resulted from trapping of general transcription factors
‘at genomic sites. Mutations that break the Interaction
between GAL4-VP16 and general factors would allev!-
ate toxlelty and identity transcriptional adaptors, it
‘adaptors bridged the interaction between activators
‘and genoral factors. We thus identified ADA1, ADA2,
‘and ADA3. Mutations in ADA2 reduced the activity of
GAL4-VP16 and GCN4 In vivo. ada2 mutant extracte
‘exhibited normal basal transcription, but were defec-
tive in responding to GALS-VP16, GCN&, or the dA:aT
activator. Strikingly, the mutant extract responded ike
wild type to GAL4-HAP4. We conclude that ADA2 po-
tontlates the activity of one class of acidic activation
domain but not a second class.

 

 

  

‘Transcription of eukaryotic genes often requires sites that
fact at great distances from the promoter, termed en-
hhancors in mammalian co's (Banerj etal. 1981; Moreau

aL. 1981) and UASS in yeast (Guarente etal, 1982)
Enhancers or UASs are bound by transcriptional activator
proteins that contain two functional domains, one that die-
{ales ONA binding, and a second that activates transcrip-
tion (Brent ang Ptashne, 1985) The uctivation domains of
several yeast activators are characterized by a high con-
tent of acigic amino acids (Hope and Struhl, 1986; Ma and
Ptashne, 19872). Activation domains from metazoans are
‘of several classes, including acidic, glutamine rich, and
proline rich. The acidic activators, such as yeast GALA,
will activate transcription in many eukaryotic organisms,
Including mammals (Ptashne, 1988). Thus, the mecha:

be conserved in most or all eukaryotes. Metazoan acidic
activators can work in yeast, while nonacidic activators

histones on promoters. n vito studies show that the mag-
‘nitude of activation is actualy increased ifthe transcription

the DNA template into chromatin (Workman etal, 1991;
Leybourne and Kadonaga, 1991). This increase in the
‘magnitude of activation is due toa strong repression of the
basal levelof the in vitro transcription reaction by chroma-
tin. In yeast cells, a reduction inthe synthesis of histones

Howover, activators are also capable of functioning by
