Abstract. The receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphe-
tase, PTPy, displays structural similarity to cell-cell
adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfam-
ily. We have investigated the ability of human PTPy to
function in such a capacity. Expression of PTPy, with
‘or without the PTPase domains, by recombinant
baculovirus infection of Sf9 cells induced their aggre-
gation, However, neither a chimeric form of PTPy.,
containing the extracellular and transmembrane seg-
‘ments of the EGF receptor and the intracellular seg-
‘ment of PTPy, nor the intracellular segment of PTPy
expressed as a soluble protein induced aggregation
PTPy mediates aggregation via a homophilic mecha-
nism, as judged by lack of incorporation of uninfected
‘9 cells into aggregates of PTPh-expressing cells

 

Homophilic binding has been demonstrated between
PTPy-costed fluorescent beads (Covaspheres) and en-
dogenously expressed PTPs: on MvLu cells. Addition-
ally the PTPu-coated beads specifically bound to a
bacterially expressed glutathione-S-transferase fusion
protein containing the extracellular segment of PTPy.
(GSTIPTPy) adsorbed to petri dishes. Covaspheres
coated with the GST/PTPx. fusion protein aggregated
in vitro and also bound to PTPy expressed en-
dogenously on MvLu cells. These results suggest that
the ligand for this transmembrane PTPase is another
PTPy molecule on an adjacent cell. Thus homophilic
binding interactions may be an important component
of the function of PTPy in vivo.

 

 

proteins is an essential component of the modulation

‘of signal transduction processes involved in cell
‘growth and differentiation. The dynamic balance of cellular
phosphotyrosine levels is achieved by the opposing actions
of the protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs): and protein tyrosine
phosphatases (PTPases). The PTKs are a structurally di-
‘verse group that includes growth factor receptors and a sub-
stantial number of oncogene products, including members of
the sre family. It is now apparent that PTPases rival the PTKs
in structural diversity and complexity. PTPases have the
potential to oppose the effects of kinases as illustrated by
their ability to suppress the transforming potential of onco-
genic PTKs (Brown-Shimer et al., 1992; Woodford-Thomas
et al., 1992; Zander et al., 1993). However, the PTPases
should not be viewed simply as PTK antagonists. Overex-
pression of PTPa leads to dephosphorylation and activation
of e-sre and induces cell transformation (Zheng etal., 1992).
In addition, CD4S has been showa to play an essential role
in signal transduction through the T cell receptor, also poten-
tially exerting its effect through the dephosphorylation and
activation of sre-amily PTKs such as fck and fin (reviewed

in Trowbridge, 1991). Current evidence clearly indicates an
essential role for the PTPases in cellular signaling

PTPases exist in both soluble and transmembrane, re-
cceptor-like forms, (Charbonneau and Tonks, 1992). "The
structural features of some of the enzymes suggest a role for
subcellular localization in the regulation of activity, In the
‘case ofthe receptor PTPases, similar to the receptor PTKs,
there is the potential for regulating activity by the binding of
ligands to the extracellular segment of the protein. Several
of the transmembrane PTPases are members of the immuno-
globulin superfamily and display structural motifs in their
extracellular segments that are suggestive of a role in
cell-cell adhesion (Streuli et al., 1989; Fischer etal, 1991),

Cell-cell adhesion molecules are grouped into two major
families on the basis of homology and conditions for bind-
ing: the immunoglobulin superfamily (generally calcium-
independent) and the cadherin family (caleium-dependen}
N-CAM is prototypical ofthe immunoglobulin superfamily
‘of adhesion molecules. It contains five immunoglobulin do-
mains and two fibronectin type-II repeats in the extracellu-
lar segment (reviewed by Edelman and Crossin, 1991),
‘Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion mole-
cules that associate with the actin cytoskeleton by interac-
tions of their cytoplasmic domains with proteins termed
‘catenins (Ozawa et al., 1989). Both N-CAM and the cadhe~
rins bind by a homophilic mechanism (Edelman etal, 1987;
Hall et al., 1990; Rao et al., 1992; Takeichi, 1991)
