Introduction

Northern leopard frogs, Rana pipiens, may be aflicted with a herpesvirus-
induced renal carcinoma (4,15, 19,23). Populations ofthe frog that are vulnerable to
the tumor are exposed to long periods of cold (4°C) uncer the ice of frozen lakes from
about the beginning of November until the following April. ‘Phe frog encounters
increasingly warmer temperatures after hibernation until mid- to late-summer when
afternoon air temperature is commonly warm (23 to 35°C) and may occasionally:
become hot (38 w 40°C),

Frogs, as other amphibians, are ectothermic (=poikilothermic). ‘Thus, their
body temperature fluctuates with environmental temperature, It might be antici.
pated that ambient temperature would have a biological effect on the tumor of an
cetothermic animal exposed to different temperatures, Metastasis is spontaneous in
the frog renal carcinoma (5,18). In a study designed to ascertain the effect of
temperature on metastasis, Laucke and Schlumberger (6) reported that 76 per cent of
well-fed tumor-bearing frogs maintained ut 28 C for 30 dav had widespread, lars,
‘metastatic ined for three times as
