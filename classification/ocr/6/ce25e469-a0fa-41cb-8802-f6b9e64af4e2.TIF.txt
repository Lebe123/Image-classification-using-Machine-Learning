Austact Pulmonary function studies were
‘carried out in a group of asymptomatic nonsmoking
‘adults with intermediate alphaloantitrepsin de-
ficiency who were attending an exly disease detec-
tion nit in Rochester, N. ¥. All subjects were
{dented by specie protease inhibitor (Pi) ping
Fifteen MZ and 14 MS subjects who had never
smoked cigarettes were matched by sex and age €
MM contols. Spirometry, static lang volumes, and
single breath-ifusing capacity were identical in all
PI type grocpe with no etatstically signifant aif
ferences noted, Maximal expiratory tow volume curves
were abtuined in all subjects. MZ. subjects demon
stated statistically significant impaired ‘maximal
flow mates at 75%, 80%, and 25% of vital capacity
compare! to their MM contos. Total pulmonary
resistance by the oscillometric method was measured
33,5, T-and Scycle/sin he same subjects, Tnereased
Fequency dependence of resistance (defined a5 the
diference between total pulmonary resistance ot 3
‘yells and 9 eye's) was observed in MZ, subjects
‘compared to MM controls. No differences were noted
bby this method im MS-Al pairs. The data suggest
that detecable mechanial abnormalities are present
in subjects withthe NZ phenotype, even in the ab-
sence of erublished risk ftom such as cigarette
smoking and high ar polltion..

INTRODUCTION

Lavrel and Eriksson fist described in 1963 an as10-
Cation between alph-Lantieypsia (AATY deficiency
tnd pulmonary emphysema (I). It is now known that
Serum AAT is Inherted in a multiallelie, autosomel,
Codaminant pattern. So far, 25 cedominint protease
Inhibitor (Bi) alleles that determine the amount of
circulating. serum AAT have been described (2
‘Approsimately 00% of human subjects have Ps type
MAM with levels of alphi-Lantinypsin of appror-
‘mately 225 mg/100 ri. In contmst, subjects with the
fare Pi type 22 have serum AAT levels in the orde=
of only 25 mg/100 ml. This ZZ state has been wn-
equivcally associated with pulmonary emphysema
‘characterized by onset in ealy adulthood (3

“The clinical significance of intermediate levels of
AAT i curently under intensive investigation. In
particular, attention has been focused on individuals
With Pi type BZ, who characteistically have only
[55-60% of normal AAT-concentmation, and Pi Ne
(MS, with 80-€5% of normal values (4), The MZ
heterorygote state has been estimated to occur in
about 25% and the MS in 6-5% of various normal
‘populations (8). Studies to date have not conclusively
established that intermediate deficiency of AAT is
fa important risk factor in the pathogenesis of ehronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Sever fac-
tors that ray have contibuted to varying results
Ihave teen Wentified. For example, ip many studles,
specific Pi typing hes not been wtliced, and only
‘quantintive determinations of AAT have been used
(6-8). Te ts now known that Weve simpler tests
