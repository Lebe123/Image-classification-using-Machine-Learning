Objectives. We evaluated the influence of passive smoking on
experimental atherosclerosis in cholesterol-fed rabbits.

‘Background. Exposure to environmental (obacco smoke (ETS)
has been epidemiologicaly linked to death from ischemic heart
disease im nonsmokers.

‘Methods. New Zealand raale rabbits were randomly divided
Into three groups after 2 weeks of 20.3% cholesterol diet. Sixteen
rabbits were exposed fo 2 high and 16 rabbits to 2 low dose of
ETS; 32 rabbits located in another room served as an unexposed
control group. After 10 weeks of ETS exposure, all rabbits were
elle, and the percent of sortc and pulmonary artery endothelial
surfaces covered by lipid lesions was measured by staining and

‘Results. Average air nicotine, carbon monoxide and total
particulate concentrations were 1,040 g/m’, 60.2 ppm and
32.8 mg/m? for the igh dose ETS group, 30 g/m’, 18.8 ppm and
4.0 mg/m? for the low dose ETS group and <1 g/m, 3.1 ppm
and 0.13 mg/a® for the control group. The percent atherosclerotic

{involvement of the aorta and pulmonary artery increased signii-
‘cantly with ETS exposare (forthe aorta, 30 + 19% (mean # SD]
for the control group, 36 = 14% for the low dose ETS grovp and

pulmonary artery, 22 + 15% for the control group, 29 # 25% for

group, p < 0.001). Bleeding time was shorter im the
two ETS groups than in the coatrol group (86 + 17 vs. 68 + 15,
68 + 18 s, p< 0.001). There were no significant differences in
serum triglycerides, cholesterol and high density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol atthe end of the study.

Conclusions, Environmental tobacco smoke affects platelet
‘function and increases aortie and pulmonary artery atheresclero-
‘is, This increase of atherosclerosis was independent of changes im
seram lipids and-exhibited a dose-response relation. These results
are consistent with deta from epidemiologic studies demonstrating
that ETS increases the risk of death due to heart disease.

Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is the term used to
describe tobacco combustion products inhaled by nonsmok-
ers in the proximity of burning tobacco. More than 4,000
constituents have been identified in cigarette smoke, Most
exposure to ETS is from sidestream smoke emitted from the
‘burning tip of the cigarette. Sidestream smoke is hazardous
because it contains high concentrations of ammonia, bea-
zene. nicotine, carbon monoxide and many other carcino-
‘gens and irritants (1-3).

Passive smoking involves breathing both sidestream
‘smoke that goes directly into the air from the burning tobacco
products and mainstream smoke after it has been exhaled by
‘smokers. Sidestream smoke has higher concentrations of nox-

fous compounds than does mainstream smoke. It has been
estimated that approximately 50 million nonswoking adults
‘over the age of 35 years ae regularly exposed to eavironmental
‘wbacco smoke. Additionally, $07 of al children live in fami-
lies with one or more smokers (4. The effects of passive
smoking on health have been reported to include shorvierm
effets, such as exacerbation of asthma and angina, as well as
Jong-term effects, such as increased tisk of lung cancer, respi-
ralory tact infection and atherosclerosis (1-7).

Environmental tobacco smoke adversely affects platelet
function and damages arterial endothelium, and depresses
cellular respiration atthe level of mitochondria (4,5). People
exposed to ithave significantly thicker arterial walls than do
‘unexposed nonsmokers. and wall thickness is increased with
increasing exposure (8). Passive smokers also have signifi
cantly depressed bigh density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol
levels and significantly elevated ratio of total cholesterol to
HDL cholesterol levels ().

‘The materials in ETS may thus accelerate the develop-
ment of atherosclerotic plaque. Previous experimental
studies. however, showed that exposure to smoke from
only 1 cigarette/day for 11 to 13 months failed to quantite-
tively affect atherosclerosis or serum lipids (10). We de-
signed the present study to further evaluate the influence
