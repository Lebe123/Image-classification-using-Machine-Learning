Abstract. ‘The expression of vinculin, a major com-
ponent of adhesion plaques and cell-cell junctions, is
‘markedly modulated in cells during growth activation,
Gifferentiation, motility and cell transformation. The
stimulation of quiescent cells by serum factors and the
culturing of cells on highly adhesive matrices induce
vinculin gene expression, whereas the transformation
of fibroblast and epithelial cells often results in de-
‘creased vinculin expression (feviewed in Rodriguez

pression on cell behavior, 313 cells were transfected

ICROFILAMENTS are major cytoskeletal compo-
M en of evar els nvoled in determining

cell shape, dynamics, and adhesion. At cell junc-
‘ions ether with other cells, or with the extracellular matrix
(ECM),! microfilaments are linked to transmembrane re-
ceptors ofthe cadherin and integrin families by cytoplasmic
adherens junction (AJ) plaque proteins (Burridge et al.,
1988; Geiger and Ginsberg, 1991; Tukitaet al, 1992). Vi
calling a major and ubiquitous, AJ plaque component (Gei-
get, 1979, 1989; Burridge et al., 1988), whose complete se-
{quence (Cotou and Craig, 1988; Price etal, 1989) and the
protein domains involved in its interaction with other junc-
tional proteins were determined (Bendori etal, 1989; Jones
etal, 1989; Westmeyer et al., 1990).

White vinculin belongs to the group of “household” struc~
tural proteins, its expression may be modulated in a variety
of cell types in culture and in vivo. For example, cultured
fibroblasts regulate vinculin mRNA and protein synthesis in
response to changes in cell contacts and shape (Ungar etal.
1986; Bendor et al., 1987). Vinculin organization and ex-

10-30% of control levels were isolated. These cells
showed a round phenotype with smaller and fewer
vinculin-positive plaques localized mostly at the cell
periphery, In addition, they displayed an increased
‘motility compared to controls, manifested by a faster
closure of “wounds” introduced into the monolayer,
and by the formation of longer phagokinetic tracks.
“Moreover, the antisense transfectants acquited a higher
cloning efficiency and produced larger colonies in soft
agar than the parental counterparts, The results dem
‘onsteate that the regulation of vinculin expression in
cells can affect, in a major way, cell shape and moti
ity, and that decreased vinculin expression ean induce
cellular changes reminiscent of those found in trans-
formed cells.

 

 

pression are also regulated during differentiation ofa variety
of cell types including granulosa cells (Ben-Ze'ev and Am-
sterdam, 1987), adipocytes (Rodriguez Fernéndez and Ben-
Zeev, 1989), smooth muscle cells in culture (Belkin etal,
1988), and migrating epithelial ces in vivo (Zieske et al.,
1989), In addition, vinculin organization (Ridley and Hall,
1992) and vinculin gene expression are rapidly and tran-
siently stimulated in quiescent 373 cells after serum-factor
stimulation (Ben-Zeev et al., 1990; Bellas etal, 1991), and
in regenerating rat liver (Glick et al., 1992). Moreover, the
level of vinculin is reduced or even undetectable in certain
malignant cells of fibroblastic and epithelial origin which
also have a diminished microfilament system (Raz et al,
1986; Rodriguez Fernéndcz et al., 1992a), The molecular
