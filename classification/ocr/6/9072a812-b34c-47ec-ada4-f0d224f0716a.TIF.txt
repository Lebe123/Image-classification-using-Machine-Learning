The estimation of risk from exposure to a carcinogen has
‘become an important question due to the presence of chemicals
Jn the workplace snd environment. Most risk estimates are
based on long-term studies laboratory snieals ta Which

 

tumorigenicity is demonstrated following chronic exposure to
high doses or the maximum tolerable dose of given carcinogen

Ing high-dose tumor data in a Taboratory animal to low-dose
human exposure. Often linear extrapolations are performed te
predict the tumorigenic potential of a compound. However,
thes estimates rely on the applied dese ofa chemical and often
‘overlook the fact that uptake, transport, and distribution to
target tissues rarely are bear processes. Moreover, many gen
‘toxic compounds require metabolism which could subse
‘quently lead to thei removal from the cll by detoxiBeation
pathways prlor to any electrophilic interaction with DNA. In
fddition, covalent binding to DNA will nt always result inthe
fixation of promutagenic damage if the damaged template is
repaired before cell replication has been initiated. ‘Thus, the
Saturation of detoxification and repair pathways may be impor
tant factors in determining the relationship between the dose
