Transcription of cellular immediate-early genes is rapidly
induced by treatment of cells with serum and many different
growth factors (reviewed in reference 13). The promoters of
‘many of these genes, such 3s cos, contain a serum response
clement (SRE) which is required for regulation by many ofthe
lucing agents (reviewed in reference 34). Some immediate.
carly genes, however, do not appear to contain SRE regulatory
sequences and therefore must be regulated by other elements,
One such gene that we have examined is the cjun proto.
‘oncogene (12), Serum induction of eun mRNA peaks within
30 min of treatment and returns to basal levels after 2 t0 4 8
(8, 28). Induction of ess oscurs primarily at the transetip.
‘onal level, as shown by nuclear cun-on assays (27, 29).

‘The ¢,jun promoter region between ~117 and ~50 contains
binding sites for the transcription factors Spl, CTF, AP-1, and
MEFZ (I, 11), The MEF? site was found to mediate scrum
induction of a reporter gene, and the MEF2 binding sequence
at ~59 in the eum promoter was found to be required for

im and epidermal growth factor (EGE) induction of the
zit promoter (11, 25). The MEF? site was originally defined
ng. required clement in the enhancers of several muscle-
specific genes and is bound by a family of factors termed.
MEP2A, “B, -C, and -D (also termed RSRFS) (2,3, 10. 15,
2-25, 38).
MEF? family of factors have common DNA. binding
located at the amino termini of the proteins. ‘The
i similar to that of MADS box proteins, a family of
DNA-binding proteins comprising serum response. factor
(SRF), the yeast regulatory proteins MMI and ARG8O, and.
several plant proteins (reviewed in reference 33). The consen-
sus DNA binding sequences of MEF2 factors, CTACAY
T)ATAG. are found in the regulatory regions of many muscle
specific genes and at least two growth factor-indueible genes
(€zi and nur7TINEGL-BINI0) (5), The MEF? site has been

‘moter abolished expression of a reporter gene in a subset of
‘myogenic precursors, demonstrating the importance ofthis site
for precise celltype-speciic expression (6, 37). MEF? site
binding stivity is also induced during differentiation of skele
tal myoblasts in culture and fibroblasts induced to myogenic
conversion by MyoT? family members (7, 10, 19). tn Xenopus
levis, MyoD also induced MEF2A and -D expression, and
ectopic expression of Xenopus MEF2D was able to stimulate
cardiac muscle-specific gone expression in eultured blastula
animal pote extracts (3). These results suggest that MEF?
proteins act dowastceain of MyoD-like factors 40 drive muscle

Expression of all of the MEF2 family members and certain
specific splice variants is found in muscle cells, Expression of
MEF2A and -D mRNA, however, has been found in ather celts
types (25, 38), unk! MEF2C expression was found in cortical
‘neurons aswell as uifterentiated muscle cells (23. 2+). MET2D
