ved oligosnecharides, found in the
Escherichia coli periplasmic space (Schulman, Hund
Kennedy, B. P. (1979) J. Bacteriol. 137, 686-688), are
composed of 8-10 units of glucose, the sole sugar, in
3-2 and fil-+6 linkages (Schneider, J. F., Reinhold,
\., Rumley, M. K., and Kennedy, E. P. (1978) J. Biol.
Chem. 254, 10135-10188). Oligosaccharides in this fam-
ily are variously substituted with succinyl ester resi-
dues, ax well as with 6n-I-phosphoglycerol and
phosphocthanolamine, both derived from membrane
Phospholipids. These negatively charged oligoxwecha-
Fides may function in cellular osmoregulation since
their evnthesis is under osmotic control (Kennedy,
P. (1982) Proc. Na U.S. A. 79, 1092-1095).

‘We now report initial characterization of an enzyme
catalyzing transfer of phosphoglycerol residuee from
phosphatidylglycerol to membrane-derived oligosuc-
charides or to synthetic f-glucoside acceptors. The
products are en-1,2-diglyceride and f-glucoside-6-phos
phoglyeerol. Localized in the inner membrane, th
transferase has a requirement for divalent cations, of
which manganese is most effective, and a pH optimum
of 8.9 in vitro.

‘A model outlining # possible pathway for the biosynthesis
of MDO (Fig. 1) has been presented (8). In this model, an
‘essential precursor is UDP-glucose (9), whose glucose residues
are thought to be transferred to lipid carter. These nascent

utilize phosphatidylglycerol as a source of phosphoglyceral
residues, functions in the formation of multiply substituted
soluble forms of MIJO in the periplasmic compartment (8)
