‘The effect of pulmonary emphysema on expiratory fo lim
tation was studied by obtaining a static pressure-volume curve
and flow-volume curves duriag natural and forced defiation
(on lungs excised from $1 normal Syrian golden hamsters and
39 hamsters teated with papain. The lungs eated with
papain showed varying degrees of emphysema asoriated with
fan increase of lung compliance. However, the airway resist-
lance during natural deflation was unaffected, The maximal
flow for a given hung volume was invereely related to the lung
compliance, and was comparable to the maximal flow in
fhormal lungs obtained at a lower lung volume with compa-
rable tung recoil force, The moderate flow limitation in the
‘emphysematous lungs was considered largely a result of the
seduced lung recoil force.

Goose er at. have produced pulmonary emphy-
sema in Syrian golden hamsters by the intratracheal
instillation of papain solution and by inhalation of
aerosolized papain (4, 5). Unlike human emphysema,
‘where coexining chronic bronchitis is common, the air-
‘ways in these animals were normal except for dilatation
of terminal bronchioli. Thus, this experimental prepara-
tion enabled us to study the effect of emphysema, un-
complicated by chronic bronchitis, on the flow-pressure-
volume characteristics.

 
    

MATARIALS AND ocrHoDs

|A study was carried out on 39 treated animals and on
31 control animals. Of the 39 treated animals, 5 were
treated with a single exposure to acrosolized papain, and
the rest were treated with single or repeated intratracheal

instilations of papain. The control animals received
cither no treatment or saline treatment intratracheally ot
through inhalation exposure, ‘The animals treated with
saline did not show any lung pathology. The animals
treated with papaia showed a massive hernorshagic in-
flammatory reaction immediately after the treatment,
followed by the development of emphysema. The inital
inflammatory reaction subsided within 1 week. ‘The
physiological measurements were made at least 1 week
ater the final teatment. An example of severe eo:phy-
semua produced by teatment with aerosolized papain is
Showa in Fig. 1. Details of the method of production of
emphysema and the pathological findings will be re-
ported elsewhere (5).

‘Although the animals teated with papain lost weight
temporarily, they regained weight, and the distribution
of age and body weight at the tine ofsacriGce was similar
in the two groups, as shown in the Table 1.

Immediately after the animal was sacrificed by a lethal
dose of pentobarbital, the lung was carefully removed,
together with the heart, and placed in a body plethys
graph with the tachea tied around a conducting tube.
The plediysmograph used was similar to the one de-
scribed by Mead (8) (Fig. 2). The total air volume of the
plethystuograph was approximately $ liters, and a
Change of volume caused a pressure change of approx
mately lem H.O. The pressure change in the plethysmo-
sgraph was picked up by a sensitive pressure transducer
(Statham PL5-0350) a8 a volume signal. ‘The flow was
obtained by electric differentiation of this volume signal.
‘The calibration of volume and flow was carried out
electrically as shown in the APPENDIX

‘Using a 10-ml syringe and monitoring the inflation by
the airway presure, we slowly inflated the lungs of the
control group until the airway presure reached ap-
proximately 20-25 cm H,O pressure. Depending on the
size ofthe animal, an injection of 2.5-6.0 mi of air was
necessary for full inflation. In treated animals an amount
of air similar to that used in a control of the similar
‘weight was injected to obtain full inflation. After full
