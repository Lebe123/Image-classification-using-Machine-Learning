Tyrosine kinases and tyrosine phosphatases are abundant in central nervous system tissue,
yet the role of these enzymes in the modulation of neuronal excitability Is unknown. Patch-
clamp studies of an Aplysia voltage-gated cation channel now demonstrate that a tyrosine
phosphatase endogenous to excised patches determines both the gating mode of the channel
and the response of the channel to protein kinase A. Moreover, a switch in gating modes
similar to that triggered by the phosphatase occurs at the onset of a prolonged change in the
excitability of Aplysia bag cell neurons.
