We have isolated and characterized a rat 8-opiold
receptor. The deduced amino acid sequence (372 12)
closely resembles the murine 8-opioid receptor,
DOR-1. In fact, 97% of the amino acid residues are
conserved between the two species, while 93% of the
nucleic acid residues are identical. A 6 kb mRNA was
detected in rat cortex using rat DOR-1 as a probe.
‘When expressed in COS cells, the clone shows high-
affinity opioid binding with selectivity for 8-opioids.

INTRODUCTION

While well defined pharmacologically, the opioid
receptors have until recently been refractory to molecular
cloning. Opioid receptors have been classified into three
‘groups, delta (6), mu (1), and kappa (x) (Lord et al.,
1977; Martin ct al., 1976; Goldstein et al., 1971; Simon
et al., 1973; Pert and Snyder, 1973; Terenius, 1973).
‘The B-opioid receptor is selective for the endogenous
opioid peptides met- and leu-enkephalin and for several
synthetic peptides (Lord et al., 1977; Mosberg et al.,
1983). Its distribution in the central nervous system has
been mapped using receptor autoradiography; itis most
dense in olfactory-related areas, cortex, caudate puta-
‘men, nucleus accumbens, and amygdala (Mansour et al.,
1987). The B-receptor is also found peripherally in the
‘mouse vas deferens (Lord et a. 197). In addition, the
B-opivid receptor is found on many neurally derived cell
lines, including NG1O8-15 mouse neuroblastoma X rat
glioma hybrid cells (Sharma et al., 1975), SK-N-SH
cells (Yu et al., 1986), and PCI2h rat pheochromocy-
toma cells (Inowe and Hatanaka, 1982; Abood and Eu-
banks, 1993).

‘The murine 8-opioid receptor has recently been
cloned using expression techniques and shown to be a
‘member of the G-protein-coupled receptor family (Evans
etal., 1992; Kiefler ct al., 1992). The cloned receptor is
a mouse cDNA clone isolated from the mouse neuroblas-

toma-rat glioma hybrid cell line NG108-15. We, along
with many others, have been studying the function of
B-opioid receptors in rats. The mouse clone can be used
to detect B-opioid receptor mRNA in mouse and rat tis
sues by Northern blot hybridization; however, there are
some difficulties with using the mouse clone to detect
S-receptor mRNA in other rodent species. In particular,
anatomical localization by in situ hybridization in rat
brain has not yet been demonstrated with the murine
S-receptor clone. The goal of this study was to clone the
rat homolog of the 8-opioid receptor. While this manu-
script was under revision, a paper describing the cloning
of a S-opioid receptor from Wistar rats was reported by
Fukuda et al. (1993). The clones will be useful tools for
studying the function of B-opioid receptors in rats.

MATERIALS AND MI
Library Screening

A Sprague-Dawley rat olfactory bulb XZAP cDNA.

ary prepared by a combination of random-priming.
and oligo-dT priming was obtained from Stratagene (La
Jolla, CA). The library was sereened with a random-
primed probe prepared from the coding region of DOR-1
(kindly provided by Dr. Chris Evans, UCLA) which was
labeled to a specific activity >5 x’ 10 dpmvug (Sam-
brook et al.. 1989). The first screen was at moderate
stringency, $5°C overnight in 1 M NaCl, 1% SDS, 10%
dextran sulfate, 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0, and 100 jugim!
denatured salmon sperm DNA. The filters (NEN colony
sereen plus, Boston, MA) were then washed to a final
stringeney of 2X SSC, 1% SDS, 55°C. Out of 1 x 10°
ROB plaques screened, one positive partial clone was
obtained, 14C1, This clone was used to screen the library
at high stringency (60°C hybridization and 65°C washes
in 0.1% SSC, 0.1% SDS) to isolate a clone, 19A1,
