SUMMARY

‘A5.7-kb recombinant plasmid, called XD-T, contains the terminal Xbal-E fragment from the left end of
type 2 adenovirus cloned into the EcoRI site of pBR322, An average of 9% == 1% of input supercoiled,
protein free XD-7 DNA replicated as rolling circles with single-stranded tails ranging up to unit length and
longer in reaction mixtures containing nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from adenovirus-infected, but not
Uuninfected, HeLa cells. The adenovirus origin was mapped on XD-7 by electron microscopy at the left
‘boundary ofthe cloned adenovirus segment Since replication proceeded rightwards, we conclude that the
adenovirus 1 strand was displaced during replication. No origin was located at or near the EcoRI site on
PBR322. Reversing the orientation of the adenovirus origin reversed the direction of replication, and

deletion of the adenovirus origin abolished replication.

INTRODUCTION

Hybri¢ chromosomes containing inserted viral,
plasmid, bacterial, or eukaryotic origins of replica-
tion can be constructed by DNA cloning. Exam-
ples of cloned origins include M13 (Cleary and
Ray, 1980), SV40 (Myers and Tjian, 1980), ColEI
(Naito and Uchida, 1980), Escherichia coli (Yasuda
‘and Hirota, 1977), yeast (Stinchcomb et al, 1979),
and Xenopus laevis (Watanabe and Taylor, 1980).
