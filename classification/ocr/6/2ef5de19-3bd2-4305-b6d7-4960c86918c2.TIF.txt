controversies exist. May we say at the outset
that this presentation is not intended in any
vay as a complete review of studies by others oF
ourselves regarding tho etiology of emphysema.
Such a task would take far more time than is
available and would not fit our concept of the
‘purposes of these Amberson Lectures. We would
like to-discuss some of the principles that should
provide the basis for study of the etiology of
emphysema; to comment. on sfine of the eur-
rent and past concepts of its etiology, partiou-
larly in the light. of these. principles; and to
indicate areas in which more work might, be

To date, we believe that “speculation” is a
properly chosen term to describe the state of
‘our knowledge of the cause of emphysema. In
the past few years, come have boldly indicated
specific agents as the cause. of the disease.
Most of these assertions of etiology have been
based upon the prineipte of guilt by association,
In this connection, such general agents 28 com-
munity and industrial air pollution, infection by
bacteria or viruses, and tobacco smoking have
been incriminated. ev oxtini x

‘A full understanding of the etiology of any
disease is most complex, and the search for the
fival mechanisms whereby the disease develops
is never-ending. The primary objective in such
pursuit is to identify the necessary causal
agent or agents. This is the agent which must
be present at some time in order that the dis-
case be produced. Associated agents in contrast
to necessary causal agents do oceur and must be
‘identied as such. These tend to potentiate the
