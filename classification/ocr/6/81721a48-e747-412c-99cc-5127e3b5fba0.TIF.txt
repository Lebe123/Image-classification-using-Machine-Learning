Indoor Air Quality Problems

A proactive approach for new or renovated buildings

Clifford Moseley, CIH, CHWS

 

Abstract

Indoor ir quality problems may result in adverse health effects, increased medical
‘costs and lost production. Most ofthe efforts to resolve these problems are focused on
‘recognizing, evaluating and controling the problem afterithas occurred Asubstantial
‘numberof indoor air quality problems occur, however, in new or renovated buildings
‘and since relocations to these buildings are planned and deliberate occurrences, prob-
{ems may be avoidable or preventable. A preoccupancy intervention strategy is pro-
‘Posed that can be used by managers, heath officials and others potentially involved

Factors to be considered

Before a preoccupancy intervention strat.
‘egy can be developed, anumber of factors
should be considered. Many have received
‘extensive treatment inthe literature, and
the reader is referred tothe general liters:
‘ture for more in-depth analysis.
Environmental conditions. Environ
mental conditions that may be important
include ambient temperature, humidity
and air movement (17-18). These are the
‘three major determinants of comfort. They,
in tur, can affect the degree to which
personreactstoother stimuli For example,
elevated temperature increases sweating,
‘which hydrates the skin and increases the

 

 

 

roorganisms (spores). Poor air movement
may cause buildup of odors and contami-
nants

‘Construction materiale. The com-
position and quantity of new materials
‘sed in the building are important. It is
‘well established that new construction

materialsreleate byproducts as aresultof
their manufacturing process, sometimes
for many months after being installed (19-
24). Some byproducts that have been impli-
cated in IAQ problems are formaldehyde,
volatile organic compounds (VOCs), poly.
cyclic aromatic compounds (PAHs) and
particulate matter.

‘The characteristics of materials left in
place (inthe case of renovation) are also
‘mportant For example, although the emis-
sion rate of vapors and gases from old con-
struction materials may be negligible, the
potential for releasing fibers or par-
Seuss into the atmoephere may bave
handling during the renovation. Finishing
materials, auch as paint, wall board and

considered as well as

 

 

 

Process equipment. Equipment may
bbe changed or upgraded in conjunction
with the relocation, Copy machines orfur.
niture, for example, may be sources of
atmospheric contaminants uch as ozone,
formaldehyde, VOCs, PAHs and combus-
