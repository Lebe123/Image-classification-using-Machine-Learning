ABSTRACT

‘To Mens melanoma associated antigens (MAAS) shared by human
sodtuinespigelanoma cll. battery of murine moaoclonal antibodies
{Slotbs) co human MAA and an antiserum to S1O0 proven were tested
‘ith fur newly established guinea pig melanoma cell nes. Only the
‘succinal antibodies 149-83 and 225.28 which recogizedstine deter-
‘seats ofthe human igh molecular weightMLAA (HMW-MAA) re-
dest ith all our guines pig melanoma cell lines. To compare the
‘adag ste of MoAbs 149.33 and 225.28 with guinea pig and human
‘aisnoma cell, inhiditon binding experiments were performed with
terdinypic monoclonal antibodies which completely iahibie che binding
“aad 149.53 and 225.23 to human melanoma ces. The binding of
Moab 159.53 «0 guinea pig melanoma cells was partially intiiced by
tetidoypie Mobs MF9-10 and MKI-I80 which recognize distinet
oat idiacopes within the antigen combining sie of MoAb 149.53. On
the other band the binding of Moab 225.28 fo guinea pie melanoma cells
‘ss completly intibited by anidicypic Mobs MFII-30 and TKI-F2
sich recognize distinc private idfoopes within the antigen comb
sie of Moa 225.28. These results suggest tha the determinant recog-
sied by Mosb 149.53 on guinea pig melanoma cells is similar but not
ents o that recognized on human melanoma cells. while the deter
‘ants recognized by MoAb 225.28 on the two types of cells do not
‘ioginy any detectable siffecences under the experimental conditions
tested, The target structure onthe guinea pig melanoma cells identified
4 Moabs 14953 and 225.28 is 2.M, 280,000 molecule which has the
‘ase apparent molecular weight as one of the wo subunits of the HMW=
MAA symthesized by human melanoma cells. Sequencal immunopteci-
iting experiments with guinea pig melanoma cells showed that the
‘cerinant recognized by MoAb 14953 is expressed on subpopulation
the molecules recognized by MoAb 225.28, Immunohistoehemical
‘wing with MoAb 225.28 ofa variety of different issues from aoreal
‘ut guinea pigs shomed that he corresponding aatigeic determinant s
‘cece only in basal ells of epidermis and hr flies of shin. $100,
cn which isa eyoplasmiccoastiven of normal human melanocytes,
‘esign nev, and malignant melanocyes, was also detected inthe eyto-
sm ofthe four eulared goinea pig melanoma cells lines. The restits
the present investigation may led to better understanding ofthe
Msloeseic evoleon of the buman HMW-MAA and suggest that
‘tea pig meianoma may serve as a seful animal model fr immuio-

2 stedies and carcinogerinduced rumargeness investigation.

and 2). While early studies with conventional antisera did not
dderect any cross-reactivity between human and murine MAAS
G. 4). eecently a murine monociona! antibody raised against
syngeneic melanoma B16 cells has been shown to cross-react
with cultured human melanoma cells (5) and with surgically
removed melanoma lesions (6). The latter findings raise the
possibility that monoclonal antibodies to human MAAs may
cross-react with xenogeneic melanoma cells. Therefore in this
study we have tested 2 panel of anti-human MAA monoclonal
antibodies and a rabbit anti-S100 protein antiserum with four
‘melanoma cell lines that we have established from cutaneous
‘and visceral tumor lesions induced by 7,12-dimethylbenzan-
thracene in albino guinea pigs (

  

    

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cells, Tissues, and Purified Borne $100 Protein. The melanoma cell
lines GP-L, GP-5, GP.5, and GP-S were established from primary and
metastatic tumor lesions which developed in Hartley Strain albino
{uines pigs (Bio-Breeding Laboratories of Canada, Led. Otama, Can-
da) following 7.12-dimethylbenzanthracene treatment on their skins
(7). The cell ines have been grown in vio for more than 28 passages.
and cach cel line has exhibited relatively stable morphology and growth
characteristics Table 1). Cells were shown by electron microscopy to
contain melanosomes and/or premelanosomes* The cells were main-
tained in Eagle's miniroum esseacial medivm containing 10% fetal calf
serum at 37°C in an incubator wih a humidified atmosobere of 5%
(COs in air. The gues pig hepatoma cell lines Ll (8) and L10 (9) were

{BR and KB. andthe human lymphoid celine MANN were maintained
in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% feral calf serum and antibiotics
(100 units penicitin and 100 g/ml streptomycin). Tissues obtained
{rom normal adulc guinea pigs were fozen sectioned for immunofiuo-
rescence staining and were homogenized for absorption analysis. Puri-

splenocytes from BALB/€ mice immunized with the MoAbs 149.53
‘and 225.28, eespeesively. The later two antibodies ae directed to
distinee and spatially distant epitopes of the human HMW-MAA.
‘Moats MF9.10 and MKI-180 recognize private idiotopes within the
