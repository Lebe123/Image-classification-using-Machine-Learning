Introduction

“The presence of 21%Pb in tobacco is of special
interest because isa ong-lived (22.3 y) precursor that
suppor the alpha emiting adionclide, Po,

‘Until recently, a direct determination of low level

rmeasrig the B- or c-actviy of its daughter Bi and
Ope, respectively, after tedious and time-consuming
chemical separations. Pb can also be determined by

For thie reaon, the messurement of low level 2!0Pb

Aificaltics, 2o one has t0 establish « proper method
which is essential. Although the standard addon
method is quite general, it was cciginally applied for

‘pray spectroscopy.

 

perimental

We stood the 10Pb activites in thirteen diferent
‘ypes of tobscco plants grown in vious regions of
‘Tarkey.

‘Somple preparation

‘The tobacco leaves were oven-dried at 105°C to get
constant weight and aches at 450°C in an electric
fumsce. By ashing the plants 20Pb is highly
concentrated. About 110mg ash is produced fom 1 g

According to the required procedure for standard
addition a small anouat of 29Pb standard of known
activity was added to the ashed samples (9g) excluding
fone. Additions of the standard were equal
‘sppcoximately half, one and to evice the amount of the
2p activity extimated in the orginal sample for the
‘optimum stasis ae suggested ®

The 75 standard was prepared from 7b
solution manufactured in 1969 by Baird Atom dled
With # nonradioactive matix such a extra pre sacch
(Merck). The present 210Pb acvity inthe standard was
calculated to be 239 Bq-¢ as refer orignal solution

Finally all samples were diated to the same quantity
(14g) with starch and were extremely wll mixed (0

40.620.2 mn radius and 7040.1 mam thickness under a
reste of 300 kg for providing an easly repeted

Exuipment

‘The emission rate of 46.5 koV rays of Pb from
each sample was measured using a 38mmxI9mm
NNal(TD detector witha Be window, and a 4 chancel
‘analyzer (Ortes—7010 Model). The detector was kop n

resolution ofthis solid-state dctoctr is extemely high.
For example at 122 keV, « FWHM between 400-600¢V
Is very common for HPGe, where as 16.V is given for

solid ~ state detector is only about 3-20% of that
