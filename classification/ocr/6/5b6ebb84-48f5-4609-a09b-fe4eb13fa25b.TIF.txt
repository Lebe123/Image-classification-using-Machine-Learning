Attentional Mediation of Cigarette Smoking’s Effect on Anxiety

the presence of benign distractor, smoking narows the foes of attention, hereby redocing

{988} atention-allocation model of aleobol reinforeemen). This nation was tested by

Research has revealed that nicotine is reinforcing in both
animals and humans (Heaningfield & Goldberg, 1983).
Nevertheless, there has been some difficulty in clearly
determining the underlying mechanisms that explain why
tobacco smoking is reinforcing, Researchers have put forth a
host of theories, calling pon constructs as disparate as
arousal modulation, performance enhancement, withdrawal
relief, differential cevebral activation, release of endogenous
“opioids, and peer group identification, When asked, cigarete

field studies (Conway, Vickers, Ward, & Rahe, 1981) and
laboratory (C. §. Pomerleau & Pomerleau, 1987) studies
alike have demonstrated increased smoking, as well ss
increased desire to smoke (Petkins & Grobe, 1992), in the
presence of anxiety or stress.

‘genuinely reduces anxiety. Laboratory studies of smoking’s
effect on anxiety have yielded inconsistent results, with
‘some indicating that smoking alleviates anxiety (e.g, Gil-
bert & Spiclberger, 1987; Jarvik, Caskey, Rose, Herskovie,
& Sadeghpour, 1989; Perkins, Grobe, Fonte, & Breus, 1992;
‘Pomerleau & Pomerleau, 1987; 0. Pomerleau, Turk, 8
Fertig, 1984; Woodson, Buzzi, Nil, & Battg, 1986) and
others demonstrating no effect (e.g, Fleming & Lombardo,
1987; Gilbert & Hagen, 1980; Hatch, Biemer, & Fisher,
1983; Jarvik etal, 1989). Thus, even though the overwhelm-
ing majority of smokers clearly believe that smoking
reduces negative affect, it has boen difficult to reliably
produce this effect under controlled laboratory conditions.
One interpretation of these inconsistent findings is that if
cigarette smoking does reduce tension, it does s0 indirectly
fF in interaction With other factors, and not through some
direct pharmacologic effect (cf. Steele & Josephs, 1990).

Tt is important to note that other drugs of abuse evidence
similar inconsistencies with respect to their ability to allay
‘unpleasant emotions. Alcohol, in particular, shaces this
puzzling effect (Sayerte, 1993; Steele & Josephs, 1990). In
fn attempt to reconcile disparate findings in the literature,
‘Claude Steele and his colleagues have proposed an aitention-
allocation model of alcool reinforcement (Steele & Jo-
Sephs, 1990), The thrist ofthis mode! is that alcohol affects
‘mood indirectly, through its effects on cognition and pereep-
tion, rather than through any direct pharmacologic effect.
‘The model also implicitly draws on the literature suggesting
that anxiety (as well as other mood states) are attentional
mediated (Beck & Clark, 1988; Eysenck, 1988, 1992;
‘Williams, Watts, MacLeod, & Mathews, 1988). Specifically,
alcohol appears both to impair individuals” bility to engage
in controlled, effortul cognitive processing and to induce
attentional narrowing (ef. Easterbrook, 1959; Wacht, 1967)
such thatthe drinker cannot attend to as many stimuli as he
for she could when not drinking. Hence, when stressed
drinkers are engaged in a pleasant distracting activity that
requires attention and thought, alcohol’s reduction of both
