“Activated bleomycin” is an oxygenated iron drug
complex which embodies the drug's DNA-cleaving ac-
tivity. This activity is exercised on DNA, if present, but
if DNA is absent, the drug itself is inactivated. Hyper-
fine interactions in the EPR spectra of activated bleo-
mycin prepared with "Fe(If) and "0, demonstrate the
presence of iron as Fe(II1) and of bound oxygen ori
nating in dioxygen. Bleomycin ean also be activated
with Fe(II) and either 1,0; or ethyl hydroperoxide.
‘These latter reactions do not produce a ferrous inter-
mediate nor do they require O;. But O. is required for
the reaction of activated bleomyein with DNA to yield
the malondialdehyde-like chromogens used to monitor
DNA degradation. The attack on DNA is quantitatively
concurrent with the decay of activated bleomycin, how-
ever generated.

 

 

 

 

‘The antineoplastic antibiotic, bleomycin (1-5), exerts its
cytotoxic activity through the breakage of DNA (6). This
reaction has been studied in cell-free, defined reaction m
tures, bur its mechanism remains elusive. The DNA degra-
ation products include nearly equal quantities of free bases
and of compounds comprising nucleic base and deoxyribose
carbon atoms I to 3 (7), Neither the initial DNA lesion(s) nor
the attacking species have been chemically defined (5, 7).
Analysis of the drug reactions generating the attacking species
‘now implicates an oxygen-ligated ferric-drug species, which
we designate “activated bleomyein.”

Both Fe(ll) and , serve as cofactors in DNA cleavage by
bleomycin (8-12). This occurs without added Fe(II) if Fe (11)
is present together with a reducing agent such as 2-mercap-
toethanol, dithiothreitol, or ascorbate, which presumably
react to generate Fe(II) (10). Optical stopped flow spectrom
etry of O; + Fe(ll)-bleomyein mixtures indicates that an
‘unstable ternary complex forms quickly and yields an optical
spectral species closely resembling Fe(II!)-bleomycin (13)
‘The formation of this second species coincides with the ap-
pearance of EPR-active material (Scheme 1), We expected
these spectral changes to coincide with DNA cleavage but
found that the degradation of DNA was far slower (7) and
that the DNA-clesving activity was also more persistent. We
therefore redirected our attention to events signaled by the

changes in spectra and activity which accompany the attack
on DNA.

‘The EPR signals originating afew seconds after the addition
of 0; to Fe(ll)-bleomyein derive from two spectral species.
‘The first (g = 226, 2.17, 194), is unstable, and gives rise to
Fe(lll)-bleomycin (g = 245, 2.18, 1.89) (14-16) within a few
‘minutes (13-15). This process approximated the time course

 

of DNA cleavage (7,13, 4), suggesting that the two might be
related.
‘We have now substantiated this hypothesis and designate

 

the more isotropic and transient EPR species activated bleo-
mycin, ‘The presence of this species coincides with DNA-
‘leaving activity in bleomycin reactions either with Fe(ll) and
¢ or with Fe(III) and either H.0, or hydroperoxides. The
effect of DNA on the EPR spectrum of activated bleomycin
indicates that these materials interact directly. The reactions
culminating in DNA cleavage are summarized in Scheme 1.

EXPERIMENTAL PRoceDURES

Materials—Solutions of bleomycin sulfate (Blenoxane), a gift of
Bristol Laboratories, were prepared as described (7) Fly active
bleomycin B, was purified from Blenoxane by Dr. 8. N. Roy (18).
Solutions of *Fe(NF)(SO4)12 H.O (Mallinckrodt) were made in

bleomycin, followed by neutralization with NaOH or phosphate-froe
buffers *Fe(I solutions (7) were purged with water-saturated argon
