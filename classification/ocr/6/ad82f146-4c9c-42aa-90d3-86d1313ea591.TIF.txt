Cigarette smoking can influence the pulmonary disposition of
other inhaled materials in humans and laborataryaninials. This
study was undertaken to investigae the influence of cigarette
smoke exposures of rats on the pulmonary clesrance of inhaled,
felatively insoluble radioactive tracer particles. Following 13
weeks of whole-body exposure to air or mainstream cigarette
smoke for 6 h/day, 5 days/week at concentrations af 0, 100, of
250 mg total particulate matter (TPO#)/m?, rats were acutely
exposed pernazally 10 MSr-labeled fused aluminosilicate (#Sr-
FAP) tracer particles, then air or smoke exposures were re-
sumed. A separate group of rats was exposed to the "Sr-FAP

"then serially euthanized through 6 months after exposure to
confirm the relative insotbility ofthe tracer particles, We ob-
served decreased tracer particle clearance from the lungs that
was smoke concentration-dependent. By 180 days after expo-
sure to the tracer aerosol, about 14,20, and 40% ofthe inital
activity of tracer was present in control 100.mg TPM/n, and
250 mg TPM/m? groups, respectively. Body weight gains were
less in smoke-exposed rats than in contrls. Smoke exposure
Produced long lesions which included increased numbers of pig
‘mented alveolar macrophages distributed throughout the paren
chyma and focal collections of enlarged alveolar macrophages
with concomitant alveotar epithelial hyperplasia and neviro
Dhiliealveottis. The severity of the Ksions increased with
smoke exposure duration and concentration to include interst
tial aggregates of pigmented macrophages and interstitial Mibro-
sis, Our data confirm previous findings that exposure to ciga-
Fette smoke decreases the ability ofthe lungs t0 clear inhaled
materials. We further demonstrate an exposure-concentration
rated magnitude of effect, suggesting thatthe cigarette smoke
exposed rat constitutes a useful model for studies of the effects
Of cigarette smoke on the disposition of inhaled particles.

Cigarette smoking induces a variety of carcinogenic and
noncarcinogenic effects in humans and laboratory onimals
One issue of concern i the extent to which smoking might

uence pulmonary responses to other inhaled tosie mate
Tals. This influence could take the form of a direct alte
ation ofthe éispasition of another inhaled agent; for exam-
Pie, it has been reported that cigarette smoking delays the
Pulmonary clearance of inhaled, ingoluble partles in hus
‘mans (Bohning et al, 1982) and in laboratory animals
(Mauderly eral, 19898). In cases in which the relatively
insoluble particles contain radionuclides, retarded clear~
‘ance would increase the radiation dose and could poten
tilly modify the resulting biological effects,

Ovr laboratory is currently studying potential interac.
tions between chronic cigarette smoke exposure and in-
baled *PuO, in producing lung cancer in rats. Asa pat of
this study, we used relatively insoluble "'Srlabeled fused
sluminosilicate tracer particles (MSY-FAP) to investigate
how an intial subchronic (3 months) whole-body exporvre
to smoke might influence the ability ofthe jungs to clear
Seposited particles under conditions of continued smoke
exposure, We performed the present study to determine if
cigaretle smoke-indueed decreased panicle clearance
would be observed inthe rats and, ifs, the exten to which
decreased clearance ws (1) quantitatively similar to prev
‘ously reported values for rats exposed pernaslly 10 cg3-
rette smoke, (2) dependent on the exposure concentration
ofsmoke, and (3) correlated with histological changesin the
jung.
