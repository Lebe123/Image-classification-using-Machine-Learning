Environmental Tobacco Smoke and
Birthweight of Offspring:

A Critical Review and Analysis

of the Epidemiological Literature

 

ct
Forty papers on the association between environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)
‘exposure of the mother an low birchweight of offspring were examined ftom
the point of view of experimental design, criteria for ETS exposure, sample
size, methods of statistical analysis, individual confounders considesed, spe-
cific endpoints, and outcome, An approximately equal number of studies
employed either the prospective or retrospective design, with very few using
‘the case-control design. The vast majority of studies used a surrogate for ETS
‘exposure (meialy paternal smoking), without verification of such exposure
‘with e biochemical marker. Toe sample sizes of the studies ranged from under
100 subjects to almost 25,000 subjects. Most studies employed regression
snalysis. A considerable variation from study to study was noted in the weat-
‘ment of potential confounding variables and most stidies considered relative-
1y few of these. Most ofthe individual confounding variables were considered
{na relatively small proportion (one third or less) of the srudies. The majority
(Gimost two thirds) of the studies failed to demonstrate a statistically signif
cant association between ETS exposure of the pregcant woman and low birth-
‘weight. This general leck of consistency of association could reflet absence of
an adverse effect of ETS or methodologic difficulties such as misclassification
‘error, type Tl error, recall bias, o inadequate adjustment for potential con-
