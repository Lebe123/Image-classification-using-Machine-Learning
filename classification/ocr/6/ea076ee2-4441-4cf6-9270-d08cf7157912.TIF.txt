INTRODUCTION

Manmade vitreous fibers (MMVFs) are a class of insulating materials
that have found widespread applications in both residential and indus-
trial settings. MMVF is a generic expression for fibrous inorganic sub-
‘Stances made primarily from sand, rock, slag, or clay. Three types of
MMVF are fibrous glass, mineral wool, and refractory ceramic fibers
(RCFs) (Pundsack, 1976).
