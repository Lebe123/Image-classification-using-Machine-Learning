the role of the SH2 domain in pp60”""-mediated transformation, site-directed mutagen
esis was used to create mutant v-sre alleles predicted to encode proteins with overall

peptides. Arginine-175,4-Which makes critical contacts in the phosphotyrosine-binding
pocket, was mutated to lysine or alanine. Unexpectedly, both mutations created v-s7¢
alleles that transform chicken cells with wild-type (wt) efficiency and are reduced for
transformation of rat cells; these alleles are host dependent for transformation. Addition-
ally, these alleles resulted in a round morphological transformation of chicken cells,

INTRODUCTION

‘The cellular protein tyrosine kinase p60" has been
strongly implicated in human colon carcinogenesis
olen etal, 1987; Cartwright eta, 1990, 1991; Garcia
etal, 1991; Novotnysmith and Gallick, 1992). The ret-
roviral oncoprotein pp60"*", a mutated counterpart of
chicken pp60"", has long been used as a model sys-
tem for understanding neoplastic transformation and
is capable of transforming avian or rodent fibroblasts
to a neoplastic phenotype (Wyke and Stoker, 1987;
Parsons and Weber, 1988). Studies on a large collec-
tion of mutant alleles clearly reveal that tyrosine
Kinase activity is necessary but not sufficient for trans-
formation (Parsons and Weber, 1989). Despite inten-

sive efforts, a complete understanding of the biochem-
{cal mechanism of transformation by pp60°* is still
lacking. Nonetheless it is clear that in addition to the
catalytic domain pp60"** contains several other well-
defined domains that make critical contributions to
transformation.

The extreme N terminus of pp60"" contains the
tmyristylation domain (also known as src homol
domain 4; Resh, 1993) that is responsible for the post-
translational addition of the 14-carbon fatty acid my-
ristate to the glycine at position 2 (Kamps et al, 1985).
This fatty acid plus nearby acidic amino acids (iver.
‘man and Resh, 1992) form a membrane-binding do-
‘main that is essential for transformation by pp60"*”
(Buss et al, 1986; Kamps et al, 1986). p60" also
