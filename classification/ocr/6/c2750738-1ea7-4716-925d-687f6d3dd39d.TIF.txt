ABSTRACT.
Antithrombin IM (ATI) is an anticoagulant protein which binds and
inactivates thrombin and other serine proteinases. Little is known about
regulation of its synthesis. We confirm that ATIII is synthesized by isolated
Fat hepatocytes, and that its synthesis is not sltered by direct feedback of its.

by supernatants from macrophages cultured in the presence of ATII-
proteinase complexes. However, culture of macrophages with fibrinogen
fragment D results In production of a factor(s) in the macrophage
supernatants which stimulates hepatic fibrinogen synthesis, as previously
described, and also stimulates the synthesis of ATII and aj-proteinase

time a mechanism by which synthesis of ATI! can be regulated during
coagulation and fibrinolysis.

INTRODUCTION

In orger to maintain fluidity of circulating blood, yet allow for effective
coagulation when required for hemostasis, the plasma levels of endogenous pro- and
anticoagulant proteins must be regulated within narrow llmits. Relatively litte 1s
known, however, about the mechanisms by which synthesis of most coagulation proteins
is modulated. Antithrombin Il (ATHI) is an anticoagulant protein which Is the molor
inhibitor of activated clotting factors, particularly thrombin and IXa. ATI binds to
serine proteinases to form inactive ATilI-proteinase complexes (1). Binding is enhanced,
In the presence of heparin. Much indirect evidence exists that ATIII is synthesized in
the liver. Plasma ATIII levels fall when there Is a loss of hepatic parenchyma (2,3).
