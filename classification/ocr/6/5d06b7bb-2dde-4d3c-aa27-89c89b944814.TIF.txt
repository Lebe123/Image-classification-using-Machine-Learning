“syoo ALERTS usually represent a combination of two or
more pollutants at significantly high levels of concentra-
tion. Dependent upon the constituent buildup of air pol-
lutants during the alert, the resultant smog can be generally
designated: a) reductive, consisting mainly of carbon
monoxide (CO), sulphur oxides (SO,), and particulates,
usually in combination with high humidities and high or
low temperatures (5, 11, 12, 18, 22), or 6) oxidant or photo-
chemical, consisting mainly of carbon: monoxide, ozone
(O:), nitric oxides (NOx), peroxyacetyl nitrates, and par-
ticulates, usually in combination with: high temperatures
and low humidities (1, 10, 15, 19, 26, 27
