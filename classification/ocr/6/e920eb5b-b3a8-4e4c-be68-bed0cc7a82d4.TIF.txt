Screensavers: trends in
high-throughput analysis

pos-genomnic era, the search for
‘new drugs begins with the detection
and (hopefily) validation of a novel
target and th the development of
an asay forthe interaction ofan arti
fica! agonist or antagonist ~ and of
jis natural ligand, if known — with
hac target.

‘Asthe race co develop new chemi~

‘maceutical companies have invested
heavily in automation and robotics,
and in the high-throughput assaying
fof large compound libraries or phar-
fmacological activities against drug
receptors. The curtene sate ofthe at

fefleced the intense applied interest

Cruising the post-genomic
‘orphanage

Both ie reals of the whole-
‘gcrome-sequencing programmes
and the contents of the extensive
cexpresed sequence tg (EST) data-
bases have made it abundantly clear
that many gene products have no
close relatives in dhe databases (they
ae ‘orphane) and are of unknown
function, shat many are cell-

nemibrane receptors (especially
protein-coupled receptor), that
jer natural ligands are also
‘unknown, and thae they consequently
represent imporant novel targets for
both agonists and antagonists.
