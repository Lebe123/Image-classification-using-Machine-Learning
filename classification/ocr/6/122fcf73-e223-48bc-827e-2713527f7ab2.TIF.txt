‘The purpose of this study is to develop a quantitative extrapolation model.
for determining human risk from experimental aninal data for inhaled toxicants.
To provide the tissue sensitivity data necessary for the model, dose response
curves will be compared for animal cells exposed in vivo and in vitro and for
human cells exposed in vitro. Both rat and hunan nasal turbinate epithelial
(NTE) cells were isolated Erom fresh, normal tissue. Cadmium sulfate toxicity
was compared between human and Fischer 344 cat NTE cells exposed for 2 hr. in
vitro. The initial cytotoxicity endpoint for these studies is energy charge,
@ ratio of adenine nucleotide phosphate pools as measured by reverse-phase
Liquid chromatography. Cadmium sulfate exposure of rat and human NTE cells in
vitto caused a consistent decline in energy charge with time, In cultured
tuman NTE cells, cadwium exposure caused a decrease in net energy charge from
0.79 to 0.31, while in rat NTE cells this decline was significantly less (0.81-
0.45). Parallel studies, using nose-only cadmium aerosol exposure, were per~
formed to deteraine the relationship between in vitro and in vivo exposure.
While Little change in energy charge was seen in initial studies where whole
turbinate tissues were isolated following exposure, techniques are currently
being developed to isolate che adenine nucleotide phosphatesefrom the cat NTE
cells in situ, The results from these studies should permit a quantitative
extrapolation of inhaled particulate toxicity data from animals to humans,
