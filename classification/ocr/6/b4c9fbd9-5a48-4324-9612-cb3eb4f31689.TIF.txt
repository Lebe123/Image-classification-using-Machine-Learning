14 per cent of regular elgarctte smokers state that

Why do smokers
not give up the habit that so many-state they would
like (o shed? Despite pronouncements from health
authorities in all parts of the world, the proportion
of smokers reporting suceessful discontinuation of
smoking is from 10 to 20 per cent in mates and
3 to 10 per cent in femates (Hacnszel et al. 1956,
P. 24; Hammond & Perey 1958, p. 2,956; Cart
wright et al, 1959, p. 726; and Horn 1963, p. 391).

Immediately following the 1964 report of the
surgeon general of the United States, 8.6 per cent
of the smoking students at two U.S. colleges xe-
ported that they stopped smoking as a result of the
health hazard identified in this report (Katahn
et al. 1964). Again, a greater percentage of male
smokers (10.3 per cent) than female smokers (5.9
Per cent) reported quitting. In addition, more nat-
ural science majors (18.2 per cent) quit smoking
than did liberal arts majors (6.7 per cent). The
same students took a story-compietion test requi
ing them to create both an imaginary story and an
estimate of the amount of time which in reality
would have transpired during the occurrence of
the sequence of events in the story. Ex-smokers
tended to respond with a longer time perspective
than did students who continued to smoke, and
the authors suggest that these individuals might be
more likely {0 worry about long-term health
hazards,

Immediately before and following the surgeon
general's report, several researchers atiempted to
find effective means for discourag-ng initiation and
encouraging cessation of the smoking habit. Horn
(1960) used a variety of educa:ional approaches.
with high school students in Pordand, Oregon, but
he reported oxty minimal success ‘i: preventing the
{initiation of smoking. Both Horn (1664, personal
‘communication ) and Lawden (1965. personal com-
munleation) have attempted to help adult smokers
discontinue smoking through the use of weekly
educational meetings (Horn fn Washington) and
weekly “group therapy” sessions (Lawton in Phil-
adelphia). With both techniques, success rates
were not much higher than the 10 to 20 per cent
“spontaneous” successes reported by other writers.
The Horn and Lawton studies raise an important
question for all cessation studies: who is an ex-
smoker? Is he an individual who quits for a week,
a month, a year, oF fotever? It fs both a common
observation and an established statistical fact that
