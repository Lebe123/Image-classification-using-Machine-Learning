Were it possible regularly to induce pulmonary cancers in laboratory animals z
sf by exposure to inhalation of cigarette amoke, this would constitute good. evidence a

that cigarette smoking could cause eancer of the lung in man,

‘Most of the past work that has been done om this problem has been summarised
this year by Larson, Haag and Sivette (1) in an entertaining and instructive volume
catited “Tobacco, Experimental and Clinical Studies". This volume weighs § 1/2
Pounds, measures 1] 1/4 x 8 3/4 x 1 8/4 inches, ie 932 pages in length, and contains
references to 6,036 articles published in 1,200 journals.

We are not going to review all ofthis lierature. It ie nevertheless of paramount
importance to examine critically the experimental models and the renuls of exper
Pence ments, chiefly of those designed to induce lung cancers in animals with tobacco smoke he

and condensates, administered by various routes. We shall lio present, for what
itis worth, our evaluation of the realis ofthe experiments on the carcinogenicity of
tobaceo and it products, and their alleged role as etiologic facion in pulmonary
cancer in man.
