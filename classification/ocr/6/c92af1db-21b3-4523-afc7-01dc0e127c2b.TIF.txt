F.E. "Acute Lower Respiratory Illness in Childhood as a Predictor
of Lung Function and Chronic Respiratory Symptoms" American Review
of Respiratory Disease 140: 877-884, 1989.

SUMMARY: This study investigated the relationship of acute lover
respiratory illness (LRI) to level and change in level of forced
expiratory volumes in a cohort of 801 children, followed
Yongitudinally for a maximum of 13 yr. The co-occurrence of
respiratory illness before 2 yr of age and two or more LRI during
a single surveillance year was associated with a 20.3% lower mean
Grossâ€œsectional level of FEF25~75, and with reduced longitudinal
Change in level of FEF25~75, The effect of LRI on lung function
was Uniformly stronger for boys than for girls. Of the children
with illness before 2 yr of age and two or more LRI, six of 14
Were male asthnatics with mean levels of FEF25-75 that were lower
than those of other asthmatic children. Pneumonia and/or
hospitalization for respiratory illnes prior to the onset of study
were associated with lower cross-sectional levels of forced
expiratory volumes at entry to the study, even when
asthnatics/persistent wheezers were eliminated from the analysis
(6.1% lower level of FEV1 for a nonasthmatic boy with previous
hospitalization versus a nonasthnatic boy without hospitalization).
In the longitudinal analysis, pneumonia and/or hospitalization
were associated with slower increase in level of forced expiratory
volunes, even after adjusting for "ever diagnosis of asthna/current
any wheeze" (starting at the same level, after eight years a boy
with hospitalization would develop a 5.0% lower FEV1 than a boy
without hospitalization). Acute LRI also was evaluated as a
predictor of chronic respiratory symptoms. A strong association
was found between previous hopitalization and subsequent chronic
cough (Odds Ratio [OR]= 3.8)/chronic phlegm (OR= 7.1) at entry to
the study: eight years later, smoking was the only significant
predictor of these symptons, and no hospitalized child had taken
hp smoking. Future studies may enable us to explore interactions
between severe respiratory illness in early childhood and the effect
of cigarette smoke or indoor/outdoor air pollution.
