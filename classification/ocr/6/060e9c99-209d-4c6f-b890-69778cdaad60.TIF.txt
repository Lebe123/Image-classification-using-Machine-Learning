‘Chronic inhalation of carbon black can produce carcinomas in
rat lungs. At prevere the mechanisms underlying the rat lung
tumoe response to carbon black are unkown, although a signi
tant role for inflammation and cell proliferation haz been post
lated. To investigate the processes which may contribute fo devel
‘opment of rat lung tumors after carbon black exposure, we charac.
terized the effects of subchronic inhalation of carbon black by rate
fon mutagenesis in alveolar epthetia ells, pulmonary inflamma:
tion, inflammatory cytokinelgrowth factor expression, and long
histopathology. Beets rate were exposed for 6 belay, 5 days!
‘week for up to 13 weeks to 1, 71, and 52.8 mg/m carbon black
land the effects on the lung were characterized after 65 and 13
weeks of exposure and 3 and 8 months of recovery. Endpoints
characterized after carbon black exposure included mutation in
{he pet gene of alveolar epithelial cells changes in bronchol-
‘veolat lavage Qld markers of lung fajury and infammaton, ex:
presion of mRNA for the chemokines, MIP-2 and MCP-t, and
ung histopathology. Lung burdens of carbon black were also deter
mined. After 13 weeks of exposure (9 L1, 7.1, and 828 mglat
farbon blac, lung burdens were 356, 1826, and T86L yg eatbon
black, respectively. The lang clearance of carbon black appeared
impaired after exposure to 7. and 52.8 mgm’. Lung tissue injury
‘nd inflammation, increased chemokine expression, epithelial hy

perplasia, and pulmonary fibrosis were observed after exposure to
71 and 52.8 wnghm! carbon black, with the eects being. more
pronounced atthe higher exposure level. Subchrone inhalation of
{Li mdm carbon black did not elicit any detectable adverse lung
effet. A significant increase in prt mutation Frequency in alveo

lar epithelial cells war detected immeditely after 12 weeks of
‘exposure to 7-1 nd 52. mgim® carbon black ag well a alee 3-
‘and S-month recovery periods forthe group exposed to 52.8 me)
tm, No Increase in hprt mutation frequency was observed for pi

thelial cell obtained from rats exposed to 1.1 mpl carbon black.

in rats do not appear to be inherently genovexie (Kanematse
er al, 1980; IARC, 1987). Te exception to this is diesel
soot, a material consisting of a carbon core particle, onto
‘which are adsorbed polyeyclic aromatic. hydrocarbons
(PAHs) known to be genotoxic in vitro and in vivo (Perera.
1982). However, the contribation of diese-associated PAHS
to the development of rat lung tumors can be questioned
based on studies demonstrating inhalation of carbon black:
produces a rat lung tumor response similar to diesel soot
tearbon black representing essentially the diese! carbon core
particle with significantly less PAHS adsorbed to its surface
(Nikula ef al, 1995; Heinrich er a, 1995).

‘The lack of association between the inherent genotoxic
activity of low solubility panicles ard the development of
rat lung tumors after chronic inhalation exposure implies a
secondary mechanism for this response, In this respect, it
hhas been proposed that the rat lung tumors seen in these
particle inhulation studies represent a generic response 10
particle-elicited persistent inflammation and increased epi
{helial cell proliferation in the pulmonary region of the rat
lung (Oberdorster and Yu, 1990; Driscoll er a, 1995e).
Inflammation and the associated release of cell-derived
ants can have a genotoxic effect (Weitzman and Stossel.
1981, 1982; Jackson et al, 1989) and enhanced epithelial
cell proliferation can inerease the likelihood that oxids
induced genetic damage becomes fixed in a dividing cell
