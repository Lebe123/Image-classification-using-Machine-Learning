Both cigarette smoke and polluted urban air

\

contain very small amounts

of benzo(a)pyrene, or BaP, a substance which is carcinogenic to experimental

animals if reletively large amounts are applied in certain ways such as skin

painting or subcutaneous injection. This suggested the possibility that the BaP

in cigarette smoke might account for the high degree of association between

cigarette smoking and lung cancer; and it suggested the possibility that BaP

pollution of urban air might perhaps increase the risk of lung cancer~

Wynder and Hoffman found an average of 2.5 micrograms of BaP in the

smoke from 100 American cigarettes smoked mechanically. Based upon this, it

would appeer that even during a 1ifetine of heavy cigarette snoking, the con
centration of BaP per square centimeter of bronchial t:
be spread would be extremely small as compared with th
skin cancer in mice.

‘The concentration of BaP in the air of large
