INTRODUCTION

The vaccinia virus contains a large number of genes,
‘mony of which are required for replication and expres:
sion of the linear double-stranded 185 kop DNA ge-
nome within the cytoplasm of infected cells (Moss,
1985). Some genes, however, particularly those lo-
cated near the ends of the DNA, are dispensible for
growth in tissue culture 8s indicated by the occurrence
‘of spontaneous deletion mutonts (Wittek ef a, 1978;
Moss et a, 1981a; Panicali et al, 1981). One subset
‘of nonessential genes encodes secretary proteins that
hhave been named virokines (Kotwal and Moss, 19882).
‘The best studied member of this class is a 19-kDa pro:
tein that can bind to the epidermal growth factor recep-
torof uninfected cells and stimulate their growth (Twer:
<dzik et af, 1985; Stroobant et al, 1985). Deletion of
both copies of the vaccinia growth fector gene pre
vents virus-induced cell proliferation and diminishes
the ability of the virus to grow in animals (Buller etal,
1988a,b). Exomination of the medium of vaccinia virus-
infected cells revealed the presence of two other pro-
teins of 36 and 12 kDa (Kotwal and Moss, 19882). The
absence of these proteins after infection with @ sponts-

the gene for the larger of these two proteins vas |
cated and sequenced, a remarkable degree of simile
ity to a human protein that binds complement 4B wes
noted (Kotwal and Moss, 1988e). Recently the purifies
36-kDa viral protein was shown to inhibit the classicsl
complement cascade (G. Kotwal and B. Moss, unput-
lished) suggesting that its role may be to counterect
host defense mechanisms. The object of the prese=t
‘study was to identify and characterize the gene tor th
12:kDa protein and then to construct @ mutant de:
cient in its synthesis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Virus and cells

Vaccinia virus (strain WR), originally obtained from
the ATCC, wes propagated in HeLa cells. Plaque isc-
late 6/2, a spontaneous mutant, was obtained from 8
Continuously passaged stock of the WR virus (Moss et
21, 1981). vGKS was constructed by insertional inact
vation of the NIL ORF as described under Results,
HeLa cells were grown in Eagle's medium supple-
mented with 6% horse serum. CV-1 and BSC-1 cells
