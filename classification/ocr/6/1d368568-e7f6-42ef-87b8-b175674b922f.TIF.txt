Experimentat evidence for the existence of @ manmalian DNA
tcytosine-S)methyltransferase (B.C. 2.1.1,37) activity with a
strong preference for hemimethylated a(pCG) aites was first
Provided by Gruenbaum et a1. (1). Enzymes with thie specificity
may play an essential role in the somatic inheritance of
cytosine methylation patterns (2,3). Most cytosine methylation
occurs at the a(pCG) dimer in eukaryotes (4), and a small subset
of these sites appoar to have the capacity to provent gene
expression (5-7). In light of the demonstration (8,9) of the
faithful somatic inheritance of modification at a(pcG) dime:
methylation of certain of these sites may have the capacity to
clonally silence genes.

Highty purified mammalian DNA methyltraneferase prepars-
tions retain a strong preference for hemimethylated 4(pCG)
Gamers (10,11). Hore we report that the capacity of the
Preparation from human placenta to methylate DHA depende on the
Size of the moiety at C-5 of cytosine directing the methylation.
