development of arteriosclerotic plaques. Mott theo-
ties of plaque development have regarded SMC
‘proliferation as a reactive process, occurring it te
‘Sponse to such stimuli as injury’ or inflammation.”
Under these conditions the SMCs involved in plaque
formation are regarded 95 indistingvishable (except
for receipt of stimuli that cause proliferation) from
the Fest of the arterial wall SMCs. According to this
view, it is the availability of mitogens or other wid
‘lators of cell division rather than any unique prop-
‘erty of the responding arterial SMCs that determines
‘whether intimal SMC proliferation and subsequent
plague development will occur.

‘A fondarsentally diferent view is presetited by the
monoclonal hypothesis? This proposes that the pro-
liferating SMCs ate derived from a stobly trans-
formed and thus permanently altered cell population
that is distinct from the bulk of arterial SMCs. One
inference from this hypothesis is that there should be
demonstrable similares, on the molecular level,
between events associated with the development of
‘both plaques and tumors. Indeed, the prediction has
been made that mutagens ond viruses should ploy a
role in plaque formation comparable tothe role that
they play in mor formation. Studies including those
using cockerels as an onimat mode! have provided
Indirect support for this view. Weekly injections of
