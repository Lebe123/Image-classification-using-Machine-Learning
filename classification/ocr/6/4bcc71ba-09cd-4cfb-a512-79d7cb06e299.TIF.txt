INTRODUCTION

 

‘mediator causing hemorrhagic necrosis of murine tumors in
vivo (1), Although 1 necrotic reaction was routinely observed in
Fesponse to endotoxin administration, complete tumor regres-
sion was noted to require immunocompetence of the host and
immunogenicity of the tumor (2). The bioxctive substance re-
‘sponsible for this hemorrhagic reaction was later shown to be

‘The mechanism by which TNF? causes tumor necrosis is not
‘wull understood. Although specific binding of TNF to tumor

sensitive tumors (7), the number and affinity of TNF receptors
fon tumor cells is not predictive of theit sensitivity (19), In
addition tothe direct eytolyti/eytostatic effects of TNF. other
studies have indicared that these cytokines can activate human
‘neutrophils (6). aurment proliferation of activated T-cells (11

and enhance macrophage (12) and NK (13) cytotoxicity. Rem-
iniscent of earlier endotorin-induced tumor necrosis, invest
{ations utilizing recombinant TNF-a have demonstrated a pos
itive correlation berween tumor regression and immunogenicity
(14), Taken together, these observations susgest the role of
Additional immune components in TNF-induced tumor regres:

Culture of PBLs with 1L-2 alone, in the absence of antigen,
in serum-free, endotoxin-free media elicits » dose-dependent
Beneration of potent oncolytic effector cells (15-17). We have
‘named this effector function LAK. Our recent finding that
‘exogenous interieron y augments LAK generation only in the
Dresence of monocytes (18) prompted us to examine the effects
(of known interferon-inducible monocyte products in combina:
tion with IL-2 for LAK generation. Because Nedwin eta. have
shown that [L-2 induces TNF-a and prodvetion in peripheral
‘blood mononuciear cells, and that this production canbe further
‘enhanced by interferon + (19), we focused initially onthe effects
of rTNF-a on IL-2-indvced LAK.

Results from these studies demonstrate synergy between
IL-2 and TNF for the generation of human LAK. This synergy
‘was observed to occur with either TNF-a F-8, although neither
TNF species alone in the absence of IL-2 was capable of

te that addition of TNF-a
ith suboptimal IL-2 concentrations can
augment cytotoxicity (0 levels observed with 10 times more IL-
2alone. The enhanced tumor cytotoxicity is observed with both
fresh tumor samples and cultured cell lines and does not appear
to correlate withthe direct TNF sensitivity ofthe tumors used.
‘This information provides additional suppor for TNF as an
immunomoduiator. fn vino, the function but not the toxicity
of IL-2 and TNF is synergistic, then improved safety and
therapeutic efficacy of human immunotherapy trials may be
possible.
