Introduction

‘Selfrepor is widely used vo estate
the prevalence of cigarette smoking al-
though it has been reported to underes
‘mate the true prevalence in some popula-
tions.' Consequently, 3 number of
biologi markers have been used 10 val:
date smoking, paniculariy in studies of
cessation and of adolescent smoking.*
Few studies have examined the validity of
selbrepor ina general population sample
‘of smokers and nonsmokers, nor ina sam
ple of Blacks.

‘The purpose of this study is (1) 10
measure the dscrepancy berween smok-
ing prevalence rates as defined by sel:
repor and by serum cotinine, an objective
measure of ncoune exposure, using 3 6
tonne cutoff point of 14 ngmb:** (21 10
assess the degree of misclassifiation of
reported nonsmokers by race. education,
and past smoking behavior: and (3) t0 1
vesugate possible reasons for miselassis
