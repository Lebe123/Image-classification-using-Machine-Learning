‘with the Salmonella/microsomal activation system, ‘Test materials (crude

products from coal-conversion processes and natural erude oils) were initially

fractionated into primary classes by liquid-liquid extraction and then further

fractionated by column chromatography. Prescreening was accomplished over

-a wide concentration range .with the.Ames tester. strains. Active fractions

be established. Standard values are expressed as revertants/mg of the test mate-
Hial assayed with frameshift strain TA98 including metabolic activation with
ratliver preparations. Total mutagenic activity of synthetic fuel samples was
‘consistently higher than that of natural crude “controls.” Activities of subfrac-
tions are roughly additive and presumably reflect the mutagenic potential of
‘the whole test material. ‘These results are being extended to other genetic
“ assays. Chemical identification is carried out along with the bioassays. E
