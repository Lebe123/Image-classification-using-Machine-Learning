ABSTRACT

Tracheobronchial epithelial cells from
uinea pig are dissociated proteolytically
and maintained on a collagen gel atop a
transparent crosslinked nitrocellulose
membrane. The cells are fed from below
with a serumejre, defined medium, and ex
poted only to an air interface on top.
Maintenance in this manner allows for
polarized differentiation of groups of cells
£0 that, after eight 10 twelve dave in cul
tre, a pseudosiraified ciliated columnar
epithelium is formed virtually identical in
structure and function to that seen in the
intact animal This culture system com
bines the advantages of both organ and
cell cultures, yet eliminates major probs

tem ie suited ideally for studies of airway

INTRODUCTION

Excess secretion of mucus into
respiratory airways isthe pathogenetic
basis for development of a spectrum
of pulmonary disorders, ranging from
chronic bronchitis and emphysema to
te common cold. Thus, definition of
mechanisms involved in normal and
stimulated secretion of mucusby goblet
cells and glands lining the airways has
been a goal of pulmonary researchers
for decades. Part of the problem has
been the lack of an appropriate model
system with which 10 study. mucin

In this report, we describe a tech-
nique which allows for formation of a

ferentiated ciliated and mucin-
secreting epithelium in an in vitro sys-
tem. Proteolyticall iated. cells
from guinea pig trachea or mainstem
bronchi are maintained on a collagen
gel which sits atop a transparent, cross
linked nitrocellulose membrane. The
cell cultures are “fed” from below only,
and exposed to a humidified air iter

differentiation of isolated cells so that
after about 8 days inculture, the pseudo-
stratified columnar epithelium formed
is virtually identical morphologically
and functionally to mucosal epithel-
jum in the intact animal.

METHODS AND MATERIALS

Isolation of Guinea Pig
‘Tracheobronchial Epithelial Cells

Male, Hartley guinea pigs (250-
300 g) maintained 1 week post-receipt
with tetracycline added to drinking
water to control for respiratory infec
tion, are anesthetized by injection in-
traperitoneally of sodiumpentobarbitol
The trachea and mainstem bronchi are
aissected free and opened longitudinal-
ly. They arethenrinsed withcold, Ca"™-
free Hanks’ balanced salts solution
(HBSS) and placed ina Petri dish con-
taining 0.1% pronase. (Type XIV;
Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO)
and incubated at 37° C in 95% ain/5%
COs for I'h. The epithelium is then
gently teased off with fine forceps and a
sterile #10 scalpel blade, and the cell
sheet gently dispersed by trituration
with a sterile Pasteur pipette. The cell
suspension is then centrifuged at 125 g
for 10 min at 4° C, and the pelk

resuspended in Ham's F-12 medium
containing 10% fetal calf serum
(FCS). The suspended cells are re
centrifuged and the cell pellet again
suspendedin F-12medium + 10% FCS.
‘The cells are centrifuged & third time
under identical conditions, and the cell
pellet suspended in cold, serum-free F-
