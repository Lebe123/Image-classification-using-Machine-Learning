Studies of Cigarette Smoke Transfer Using
Radioisotopically Labelled Tobacco Constituents
Part It: The Transference of Radioisotopicaliy Labelled Nicotine

to Cigarette Smoke"

INTRODUCTION

Studies of the fate and distribution of tobieco smcke
constituents within biolopcal systems are chen greatly
fcltated by incusion of radslabelled compounds
Im the tobacco, because of the inaeased sensitviry
sand specificity azsorated with radiisotopc analyses.
‘Use of such techniques i val. however, only if the
<istbution of the added material and its combustion
products in the smoke is fly known. Before such
Aodies involving nicotine could begin st was necessary
te demonstrate that the smoke transler Guractertice
fof endogenoes and exogenous nicotine rom unifornly
labelled cigaretes were similar. In adtin to w know
Inge of the distribution of nicotine and its combustion
products in the particulate and vapour phases, s€ was
portant to detrmine whether the specie activity
of nicotine in mainstream smeke remained consart
‘eoughout the smoking. It was therefore essential to
study pul-by-pull transference of alalcids (as nico
