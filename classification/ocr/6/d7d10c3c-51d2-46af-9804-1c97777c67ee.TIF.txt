Background. The rates of lung adenocrcinoma can
sor have risen more rapidly than the rates of lung
‘squamous cell cancer over the past 2 decades.

“Methods A case-control study was carried out to at-
sexs the impact of long-term filter cigarette emoking
fon the risk of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and ad>
enocarcinome (AC) ofthe lung.

"Renulte Odae ratios for SCC among subjects who
hhad smoked only fiter cigaretios were reduced rela
tive to lifetime noatilter cigarette smokers by 80% for

jo» and by 605 for women, but no risk reduction was
‘Sbaerved for AC of the lung.

‘Conclusion. The predominance of AC over SCC may
Deduein part tothe fact that emokers of very low yield

rettes tend to compensate for the lower nicotine

white men and by 220% for white women between
1969-1971 and 1984-1965. In contrast, ver the same
6-year time peried, the rate of squamous cell carci-
noma (SCC) inereased by 25% for white men and 165%
{or white women. Among blacks, the trends were simi
lar. These rates have decelerated greatly during the
‘most recent 5:year period, 1984-1986 to 1989-1991.
SCC began to decline among both white and black
‘males, and AC decreased slightly among black males,
Dut hintology-opecide rate of both SCC and AC contin:
ued to increase among white males and among all fe-
‘ales (National Cancer Institute, unpublished data),

‘While it is well established that cigarette smoking
‘the major cause of lung cancer, the marked differences
fn the rates of AC and SCC as well as their different
‘patterns of change among men compared with women
Puggest that exposure to cigaretie smoke carcinogens
fs changing in complex ways.

‘The FTC-rated yields of “tar” and nicotine in smoke
both decreased by at Tesst 60% since 1950 due largely
{ introduction of filters (Fig. 1). Because cigarette
“tar" contains numerous eareinegens, it is plausible
that the secular changes in lung eancer rates are the
fonsequences of changes in the formulation and manu:
facture of tobacco products in resent decades. Previous
fease-contro] and cobort studies found the risk of hung
‘cancer for smoking lower “tar” cigarettes to be signi:
‘cantly lower than for emoking high-"tas” cigarettes (2).
‘However, this conclusion was based on studies of sok
fers of cigarettes that contained much higher “tar” lev-
‘ls than those commonly smoked during recent de-
cades (9).

"The extent of cancer risks associated with smoking
the newer, lower “ta:” cigarettes have not been estab-
lished because these cigarettes were only recently in-
troduced into the mare, whereas lang cancer has a
latency period measurable in decades. It ean be ex-
‘pected that lower yield cigarettes will have health con-
equences that difor from those of higher yield prod
‘ets because oftheir altered emake chemistry. Figure 2
‘shows that a long-term decline in PAHs has been ac-
‘companied by higher emoke concentrations of TSNAS
fuch as NNK, which reculted from an increase in the
Bitrate content of cigarette tobacco from about 0.5 to
15-15% [4,5], PAlls and TSNAs are both complete
