Abstract

 

«2 major odoriferous components of fresh pig slurry were identified using gas chromatography coupled to mass
spectrometry. From the analytca! data, a standard artifical slurry was reconstituted, The performance of conducting
polymer odour sensor arays was evaluated using the individual chemical volatile components and the artificial slurry
itself. Most ofthe components are discriminated fram each other, when presented singly to the sensor array. The
sensors are not poisoned by the chemicals and give reproducible responses over a3 month period. The edour
components being detected from an artificial alkaline pig slurry appear to be astoiated with patterns obtained from
indole, skatole and ammonia. The intensity ofthe signalis proportional to the concentration ofthe volatiles
~esented to the sensor. The results indicate that condlcting polymer sensor arays show promise for measurement

 

introduction

The practise of intensive livestock farming, and the
problems associated with the treatment and disposal of
cvs has raised public awareness of agricultural malodours
2 vironmental pollutants (Jones, 1977; Shusterman,
1992), Such odours may be released from ventilation
sysems in farm buildings, waste storage aad slurry
treatment systems, and the spreading of sluries on
agricultural land. Matodours emanating from ow and pig
slurries are an increasing source of eavironmental pollution
(ONeill and Philips, 1991). Many substances produced
daring the anaarobic digestion of faeces have very low

Auisances even when their concentrations i ac ae very owe

sulphides, dislphides, mercaprans and many heterocyclic
compounds (Schaefer, 1977; Willams, 1984). It has been
reported that environmental odours greatly affect the
Piysiological and psychologzal starus of @ human popula-
tion. A recent study on the effet on a population exposed to
aalodours ‘tom pig farms reports more tension, depression
and anger, reduced vigour, increased fatigue and more
confusion than a control population (Schiffman e ol,
1995).

The narure of very odourous compounds is such tha they
are doteted by the human ose even when less odourous
compounds are present at higher concentrations For an
odorant, the peresived intensity of odour is proportional to
a fractional power of the conceatration. Methods of odour
