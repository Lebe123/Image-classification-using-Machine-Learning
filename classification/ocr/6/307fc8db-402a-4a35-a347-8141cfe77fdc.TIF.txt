‘SUMMARY

In order to demonstrate quantitatively that cigarette-smoking baboons
inhale particulate matter into the lung, a bronchoalveolar lavage method
for recovery of [C]dotriacontane was developed. First, 9 baboons were
exposed to a known dose of ['*C]dotriacontane labeled particulate matter
delivered in a manner providing extensive deposition of particulates in the
lung. The hungs of these passively exposed animals then were lavaged so
that ‘the efficiency of recovery of the standardized lavage procedure could
be determined, Second, 9 baboons actively smoked labeled cigarettes, and
the lungs of these animals were lavaged to recover labeled ('*C]dotriacon-
tane. The total amount of particulate matter present in the lungs was
estimated using the efficiency factor previously determined. The smoking
baboons retained an average of 9% of the total cigarette particulate matter.
Differences among animals in retention of particulate matter were con-
siderable, and the inter-animat variability was related to differences in
number, volume, duration, and pressure of puffs. The retention of particu-
