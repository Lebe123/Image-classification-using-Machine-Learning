We recently identified a DNA sequence element located in the rat c-mos
protooncayene which fulfills operational criteria for enhancers, incress tne
transcription from a heterologous promoter in fibroblasts over large
distances and in an ortentation-tadependent manner. Here we report. that
three mouse nuclear proteins bind to the enhancer. Several ines of evidence
indicate that one is a Nuclear Fattor I like activity. Oligonucleotide.
{tracted mutagenesis of the Mf-1 binding site. destroys binding of the pre:
tefn, but leaves enhancer activity unaffected. Tumor gronth factor-B, which
yas Shown to exert a stimulatory effect on the @(1) collagen promoter via
its NE-1 binding site, has no effect on the activity of the enhancer. Thus,
the NF-1 binding site of the c-nos enhancer is not essential for its actividy

Protooncogenes are intivately involved tn cell growth and differen-

Uation. Iehibitson of c-mos expression by injection of antisense o11g0-
‘nucleotides prevents progesterone-induced maturation of Xenopus laevis
oocytes (1). Germ cells are the predosinant sites of c-nos expression (2, 3,
4, 5). The restricted tissue specificity and the Yow level of expression
have made the study of c-n0s expression and its control dificult. Because
the c-mos gene has a potent transfirming activity in fibroblasts, these cells
have been eeplojed to define functional sequences in the gos gene locus that
Modulate expression directed by viral promoters. Sequences mediating nega-
tive regulation of accumuTation (6, 7) and translation of RHA (8) have been
described. We have also previously demonstrated that 9 OWA elenent located
2 kb upstream of the coos (rat) céding region exhibits enhancer activity 40
Fibroblasts (9). Wate a possible role of this sequence in testts-specittc
‘expression ts as yet unknown, we hive data which suggests this 250 bp domain
Is located within the primary c-nos transcript of rat testis (van der Hoorn
et al, manuscript submitted). We therefore refer to this sequence as the ¢-
0s enhancer.

Recent characterizations of nuclear factors which bind to enhancers and
mediate their activity demonstrate that enhancers may be composites of
