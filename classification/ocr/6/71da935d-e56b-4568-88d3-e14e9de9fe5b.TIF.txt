SEX CHROMATIN, BODY-MASCULINITY AND
SMOKING BEHAVIOR

Summary—Aa hypothesized relationship beeweeo smoking behavior, body
susculiniy (Mare), and amouat of sex chromatio was investigated wsing 6
samples of California college students (w = 437) and 1 of 80 Indiana adults
Ratings of Mase were positively correlated with the amouac smoked by smokers
fof both sexes in all samples. Amounc of chromatin ia both buccal smears and
blood neutrophils was higher for smokers ia all samples tested. The amount
‘amoked wat negatively cortdlated for male and positively correlated for female
smokers with amount of chromatin. Amouat of ehtomacia is related to Ali in
‘Females but not ia males.

‘Carney (1967) has previously sepored the basic findings of this smady. ‘The present
seport extends the analysis to include blood cells and independently replicate the findings
for sex chromatin in ski cells. The hypothesis was chat body masculinity (Alec) is te-
lated to percent sex chromatin and that both are corelated with smoking in both sexe.

‘Method —Two samples, 70 males sod 117 females, were taken from inwoduciory pay-
‘chology cases at COU in addition w thove reported by Caroey (1967). One sample of
38 men and 42 women was obtained in Indiana?

‘Procedures were those described by Carney (1967) except thie io the TU sample the
sain vulined was Bar's Crspl Echt Violet Stain and the percent sex chromatin ($C) in
‘bocal cells was obtained io » 100-all count. The percent neutrophil (New) was obrained
from 1 drop of blood ken from the finger with disposable devices. The blood sample
‘ws tained with Wright's sain and 100 cells were counted.

“Ail sex chromatin dats were cooverted w normalized T scores (M = 50, SD = 10)
‘eparnely for each sample of Males and Females before computation of cortelatons and
1256 of significance. Smokers were defined as any persons who had ever regularly smoked

Resallz-—Table 1 summatizes comparisons of smokers and nonsmokers on the $C
saad Neat measures. In all samples smokers had higher amounss of chromatia. In both
(California and Indiana the means for smokers were significantly higher than those for n00-
smokers (see Table 1).

For smokers, Mase and amount smoked were correlated 1s follows: CWU males,
24 (p< 01,0 = 167); lndiaos rales, ¢ = 27 (p <.07, w= 33); CWU females,
22 (p< 01,» = 241); Indiana females, ¢ = 21 (p <.05, a = 18). Percent chroma-
‘dn and amount smoked for male smokers were correlated: for $6C at CWU, ¢ = —22
@< 0, 34, and for Nest at lndivaa, ¢ = —30 (P
> 05, w= 16 in both cases). Nonsmoking males had average amount of chromatin
wer than any category of smokers 40 the non-smoking males were excluded from the
shove comparisons.
