/Hea ith Effects of Smokings Current Concepts/

ocently, we issued a balanced view entitled, “Smoking and Health: A Review Prepared by the
Smoking and Health Subcommittee of the Tobacco Industries Council, A Council Formed by the
Minister of Finance of Japan” (International Journal of Addictions 26:423-440, 1981" am going to
introduce the summary of the report on behalf of the subcommittee. I also would like to present my
view on the relationship between environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure and lung cancer.

 
   

DEFINITION OF HEALTH “

Although health is by nature both a holistic and universal concept, its meaning can differ greatly
with an individual's age, living environment, and working attitude in society. The concept of health is
therefore an-extremely personal matter, and any definition must be svitebly broad and flexible,

Recently, with the decline of infectious diseases, diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and
cerebrovascular disease have become a matter of foremost concern. Although these diseases have theit
main sites in one or @ emall number of tissues or organs, most are thought to be the result of an
accumulation of causes expanding over a long period and affecting the entire system, Nor can the
profound relationship between these diseases and individual life-style be denied.

In cerrying out @ health care program, each individual must review his or her life-style from
holistic perspective, based on a full understanding of health science. Along this view, the decision
whether to have controlled smoking or any smoking at all ix entirely up to each individual by
considering his or her own personal preferences and the influences of smoking on health. Through
such judgement, one will be able to lead a healthy life

 

ADVERSE AND PHARMACOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF NICOTINE EXPOSURE

   

‘coin. the main active pharmacological substance absorbed into the body throuxh stone
on both the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system.

‘Among its effects on the periphoral nervous system, nicotine is known to increase the heart rate, 10
raise the blood pressure, and to lower the skin temperature by conttacting the skin's blood vessels by
first stimulating then blocking the autonomic ganglia. It also accelerates the motility of the intestinal
tract, increases gastric secretions, and decreases food consumption. These effects grow less strong
through repeated udministration, producing @ phenomenon known as acute tolerance,

‘Among its effects on the central nervous system, nicotine has long been known to cause convulsions,
but it is becoming clear that nicotine produces a variety of other psychotrophie effects as well. For
example, it has a biphasic action that produces a stimulating or a sedative effect depending on the
state of the body at the time it is taken. It also acts to improve performance in a variety of tasks.
Furthermore, the sense of satisfaction derived from administering nicotine can create a drug seeking
for more, i., peychological dependence. The degree of dependence is far milder than that produced
by narcotics such as heroin or by stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines, and any physical
dependence is incomparably weaker than that of heroin.

 

 

CARCINOGENIC EFFECTS OF TOBACCO TAR AND TOBACCO SMOKE

‘Tumor-producing aromatic hydrocarbons and various kinds of nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic
substances, have been detected in tobacco tar. Recently, it was reported that tumor-producing
heterocyclic amines, which ate found in heat-processed foods, have also been detected in tobacco tar.

Because it has been demonstrated that both benign and malignant skin tumors are developed by the
Jong-term application of tobacco tar to the skin of experimental animals, studies have been conducted
in which tobacco smoke was forcibly administered to animals, but it has proved extremely difficult to
produce lung cancer through tobacco smoke alone. The abnormalities (squamous metaplasia), 1... the
hypertrophy, deformation, and proliferation of the epithelial cells that line the trachea and bronchi
‘and that are known to be precancerous are said to be smoking related. But there are several phases in
this procese. and not all abnormalities in the initial stages necessarily progress any further.

 

TS EXPOSURE AND LUNG CANCER

The reintionship between exposure to ETS and lung cancer was advocated by Hirayama (Jepan)
and ‘Trichopoulos (Greece) in 1981. Esp yama's work hes been highly evaluated because it
