‘A specific type of microorganism has been observed, isolated, and
cultivated consistently from every one of hundreds of specimens,
tained from both animal and human cancer of various types over a
five year period. 1t has a polymorphic developmental pattern which
8 number of others (1-9) in various parts ofthe world have observed
‘holly or in part. Our chief contributions to the bacteriologic study
of this organism are (a) the recognition of its potential acid-fast
Properties by Wuerthele-Caspe (10-13) and (b) the demonstration
by Alexander-Jackson (14-16) of the similarity ofits developmental
‘morphology to that of the mycobacteria of tuberculosis and leprosy
which she had studied closely for more than fifteen years. ‘These con-
tributions tovards an understanding of this pleomorphic mycobac-
teriumlke organism which we have tentatively called Mycobacterium
tumefaciens, were made possible by utilizing easly repeated stain
technics and methods of cultivation which have not heretofore been
applied in cancer research.

‘The outstanding characteristics of the organism apply to similar”

‘acid-fast microorganisms which we have isolated from various other
proliferative and degenerative diseases of cbscure etiology, including
Hodgkin's disease, scleroderma, sarcoid, arthritis, and Wilson's dis.
‘ease (hepatoventrcular degeneration). ‘An experiment was carried
‘out with blood from scleroderma patients involving the intraperitoneal
{inoculation of 30 white mice and 30 contrals. During the last three
years 621 other animals, including mice, guinea pigs, and chickens,
vere inoculated with pure cancer cultures. A number of chick em.
