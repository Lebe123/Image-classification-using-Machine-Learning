700 people became ill following the ingestion of undercooked
contaminated hamburgers. Approximately 27% of those with
bloody diarthca were hospitalized, 89% developed systemic
complications. and four children died (8). A common his-
topathological finding in patients with postdiarrheal sequelae
is the destruction of endothelial cclls lining small blood vessels
in the colon, kidneys, and central nervous system (26). In vivo
studies using a number of animal models demonstrated that
purified Shiga toxin ancl SITs cause vascular damage in many
of the samme target organs (for a review, see reference 9). In
vitro studies utilizing human vascular endothelial cells (HVEC)
from a numberof sites demonstrated a direct cytopathic effect
‘mediated by the toxins, although in Some cases, the toxin co-
centrations necessary to manifest cytotoxicity were orders of
‘magnitude greater than that estimated to be circulating in the
bloodstream of infected patients (23, 33). However, when

proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha
