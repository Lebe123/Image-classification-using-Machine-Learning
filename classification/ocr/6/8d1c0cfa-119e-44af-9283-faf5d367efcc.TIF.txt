‘But itis pethaps appropriate to conclude with two notes of

are subject to a systematic illusion of tilt. It is nevertheless
difficult to see why this should lead to any increase in the
variance of the vernier settings, and indeed it is possible to
provide an explanation of the Zollner effect in terms of feature
detectors'?. Finally, mention should be made of the finding of
Ludvigh'* that vernier precision can’ be maintained in a
‘modified form of the vernier task which consists of aligning the
‘middle one of three dots. This result presents a considerable
‘problem for any theory of acuity.

“Effects of Marijuana and Tobacco

“. Smoke on Human Lung Physiology

<7 Mouse lung explants exposed to smoke from cigarettes to
Which marijuana was added have been reported to display

‘more cellular abnormalities than those exposed to smoke from

‘cigarettes without marijuana!. We report here a study designed

10 test the effects of smoke from cigarettes made of marijuana

©*-only on human lung explants, and to compare these effects

with those obiained after exposire to smoke from Kentucky
Standard cigarettes.

‘exposing lung explants to puffs of fresh smoke in standardized.

from men (45-56 yr) who had~undergone surgery because
‘of pulmonary tumours. For the lung explants pieces of
“normal! lung” were taken far distant from the tumour.
‘Absence of timour was established by microscope examina
tion. The cultures, which at three to four weeks showed a
regular monolayer of fibroblastic cells, were exposed in a
“‘Filtrona CSM 12° smoking machine to puffs of fresh smoke
{from marijuana cigarettes, orto puffs of whole fresh smoke, or
smoke of the gas-vapour phase* from Kentucky Standard
Cigarettes. Marijuana cigarettes containing 1.8 g of marijuana
(UNC 303, 0.67% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) for each
cigarette were prepared with the same paper as that for
Kentucky Standard tobacco.

Experiments were carried’ out on over 1,300 cultures of
human Tung explants. For each experiment a minimum of
‘eight sets consisting of twenty-four coverslips with matched
ung explants was used. Each set comprised a control culture
‘ot exposed to cigarette smoke, a culture exposed to four puffs
per day (25 mi. at intervals of 58 s) of fresh smoke from
‘marijuana cigarettes for 4-10 consecutive days, and a culture
‘exposed in the same manner to two puffs from Kentucky
Standard cigarettes. The lower number of puffs from Ken-
tucky Standard cigarettes was given because of the relatively
high cytotoxic effect of this type of cigarette on the cultures.
‘The larger puff volume of 25 ml., instead of 8 mi. used in the
previous study, was chosen because it resembled more closely
the standard puff volume of 35 mil. inhaled by human smokers.
Media were changed immediately after each exposure.
