Localization of a new ferritin heavy

chain sequence present in human
brain mRNA to chromosome 11 5981

‘Two types of ferritin heavy (H) chain clones have been isolated from cDNA libraries of
‘human fetal and adult brain: one corresponds to the ferritin H chain mRNA that is abundant in
liver and is called “liverlike” brain cDNA; the other contains an additional 279 nucleotide (nt)
sequence in the 3'untransleted region and is called brain ferritin H chain CDNA, To map the
279-nt sequence, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was carried out using DNA from
rodent X human hybrid cell lines containing single human chromosomes as templates, and

oligomeric primers homologous to the 3‘end of the 279-nt sequence (primer A) and to a coding
sequence just 5" to the 279-nt sequence. Significant PCR product of the size expected from
analysis of the brain ferritin H chain eDNA clones and a genomic ferritin 1} chain clone (487 bp)
‘was generated only from hybrid-cell DNA containing human chromosome 11. This PCR product,
land the “liver-like” brain cDNA (lacking the 279-nt sequence) both hybridized to chromosome 11
fragments that are known to define the well-characterized functional liver feritin H chain gene
tnd a putative pseudogene. Preliminary data indicate that primer A (and thus the 279-nt sequence)
‘maps tothe functional ferritin H chain gene fragments, but binding to the pseudogene his not
‘been ruled out,
