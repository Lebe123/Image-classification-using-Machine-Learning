Four patiens, seen ina three end one half
year petiod with primary amenorthoes due to
‘congenital absence of the wleras, have been
presented. They all had normal 46XX female
chromosome karyotype ftom peripheral leuco-

had unfused and laterally displaced Mullerian

the results ofthe numerous experiments on
