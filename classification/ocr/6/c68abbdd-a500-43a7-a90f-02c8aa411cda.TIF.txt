Dose-dependent stereoselective activation of the trigeminal sensory system

by nicotine in man

Received: 16 March 1998/Final version: 14 September 1998

Abstract Rationale: Nicotine applied to the nasal cav-
ity can evoke ‘odorous’ sensations in the concentration
range near the detection threshold by the activation of
the olfactory sensory system and at higher concentra-
tions ‘burning’ and ‘stinging’ sensations by the dose-
dependent recruitment of C- and Aé-fibers of the
trigeminal sensory system. Neuronal nicotinic acetyl-
choline receptor (nAchR) subunits are expressed in
trigeminal primary afferents and could constitute the
receptors involved in nicotine perception. Objective: In
the present study, we dose-dependently investigated the
stereoselective effects of RCH)- and S(—
the trigeminal and olfactory sensory system in man.
‘Methods: Trigeminal detection thresholds forthe ‘burn
ing’ and “stinging” sensations and the olfactory detec-
tion threshold for the ‘odorous’ sensation were
determined. In order to quantify trigeminal activation,
wwe recorded summated electrical responses from the
respiratory nasal mucosa during stimulation with R(+)-
‘and S(—)-nicotine vapor (40, 80, 120, 160 ng/ml; stim:
ulus duration: 250 ms), In addition, subjects rated the
intensity of ‘odorous’, “burning” and ‘stinging’ sensa-
tions. For chemical stimulation with nicotine enan-
tiomers, a vapor-cilution olfactometer (constant flow
rate: 140 ml/s, humidity: 80%, temperature: 37°C,
stimulus duration 250 ms) was employed, Results: We
found significant stereoselective differences for the
trigeminal but not for the olfactory system, i.e. higher
summated responses, higher trigeminal intensity esti-
mates, and lower trigeminal detection thresholds for

S(—)- compared to R(+)-nicotine. Conclusion: Our
resulls clearly demonstrate the diferent stereoselective
activation of the trigeminal sensory system by R(+)-
and S(—)-nicotine, indicating the presence of specific
stereoselective receptors on trigeminal nociceptive
‘A6- and C-fibers.

Introduction

Stercospecific binding of nicotine enantiomers has been
demonstrated for high and low affinity binding sites in
the central nervous system, and in the periphery for
binding sites at the nicotinic receptor of the autonomic
and the somatic nervous systems (Melzer et al, 1980;
Romano and Goldstein 1980; Martin and Accto 1981;
Tkushima et al. 1982; Abood et al. 1985; Sloan ct al
1985; Accto et al. 1986; Henley and Oswald 1987;
Goldberg et al. 1989). The quantitative differences in
binding values (ICs) of nicotine enantiomers seem to
be small compared to the differences observed for the
stereoisomers of opioids. Abood et al. (1985) found a
threefold greater ICsy value for R(+)-nicotine than for
‘S(~-nicotine at the higher affinity site and twioe that
atthe lower affinity site. The affinity of opioids to the
ul-receptor was 10-fold higher for RC) than for
‘S(--}rmethadone (Kristensen et al. 1995), It has been
shown in Dreiding models that the nitrogen atoms of
the nicotine stereoisomers are nearly superimposable
(Aceto et al. 1986), thus explaining the small stereo-
Selective diferences using the simplicity of the nicotine
molecule. Nicotine itself resembles. the structural
properties of acetylcholine. The pyridine nitrogen of
Bicotine is an electron donor similar to the keto
‘oxygen of the acetyl group of acetylcholine; the posi-
tive charge of the pyrrolidine nitrogen of nicotine is
