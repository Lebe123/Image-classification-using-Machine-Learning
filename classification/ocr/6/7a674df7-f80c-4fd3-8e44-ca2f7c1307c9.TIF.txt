‘The Louisiana Lung Cancer Dataset, consisting of 337 extended pedigrees. is
analyzed to determine whether a major Mendelian gene interacts with cumula-
tive tobacco smoking (pack-years). The proportional hazards model is utilized.
as itis a natural framework for estimating relative risks while adjusting for vari-
ability in age of disease onset. Segregation analyses show evidence that a Men-
delian gene is segregating in these families, with the most parsimonious madel.
including sex. pack-years, pack-years squared. and a dominant major gene. The
estimated frequency of the high-risk allele is 2% and carriers are estimated 10

‘The addition of a gene x pack-years interaction does not significantly improve
the fit of the model, indicating that on a multiplicative scale, these two factors
independently influence lung cancer risk. Smoking history is missing for 235 of
the study subjects and degree of “missingness” depends on disease status.
age, and birth-year. To account for the nonrandomness of the missing data.
Markov chain Monte Carlo method for covariate imputation is proposed and
implemented. Results from this analysis also support a nonsignificant gene

live risk (9.0) compared to the “complete ease” analysis. Genet, Epidemiol,
