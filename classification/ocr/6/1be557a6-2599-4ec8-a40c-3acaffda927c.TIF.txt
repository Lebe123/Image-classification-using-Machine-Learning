ABSTRACT

‘A.Chira AGP capillary column (150 * 0.18 mim 1.D. wat uted for the separation of enantiomers of raceme drugs. fow-raes of

by enrichment of the sume en  eapilary rapping column (48 * 0.25 mm LD). The tapping com andthe Chiral AGP capilary
column were coupled together bya switching valve. A pH and slkent micro gradient was generated inthe trapping sytem. The miro

raient could be used to compres the migrating bands onthe Chiral AGP capillary cluma. Thus, large sample vclumes could be
Injected without a signifeam decrease in detection sensi, For some compounds, 45-50% higher detection snsitnty than with
dee injection was eblained by injetion of large sample velumes ono the rapping column. Sample volumes as high #529 pl ould be
Injeted using the sarple-enichment technique. This sample volume is 330 umes higher than the volume injected directly on 10 the

the most hydrophilic rapping columns. The low fowerate used forthe Chiral AGP capillary column allows coupling wth amass

INTRODUCTION In order to be able to study the disposition of
Grug enantiomers in the body, analytical methods

are required that permit the analysis of enantiomers

 

‘The biochemical reactions in living organisms oc-

cur on a three-dimensional basis as a result of the
asymmetric nature of the macromolecules involved
in such reactions. Enantiomers of drugs can be con-
verted by the liver enzymes at
rates or they can be converted into different metab-
lites (I~). As drugs also interfere or participate in
the biochemical reactions in the organism, large dif=
ferences in pharmacodynamic properties can also
bbe obtained for drug enantiomers (5-8).

present at very low concentrations in a complex ma-
trix such as plasma and urine. [tis well known that
all chiral columns give lower separation efficiencies
than non-chiral columns. Another feature of chiral
columns is that they tend to give low selectivity for
structural analogues compared with non-chiral col-
umn. Many drugs are tertiary amines and a com-
mon metabolic pathway for tevtiary amines is N-
dealkylation, which means that secondary and pri-
rary amines are formed by the liver enzymes. Ow-
ing to the lower selectivity for structural analogues,
