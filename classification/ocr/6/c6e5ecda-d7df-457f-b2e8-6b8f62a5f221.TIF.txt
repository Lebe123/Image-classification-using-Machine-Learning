SUMMARY
Extracts of sicotinate-grown Clostridium barkeri ferment
[r-NChaicotinate to “CO, and « mixture of volatile and not
‘olatile acidic products. Thie conversion is markedly stim-
‘ated by the addition of certain intermediates of the over-all,
fermentation pathway, namely pyruvate, a-methylenegiata-
Te large scale
xperinents PeChr-methyleneglatarat, ["C}methytitacosate,
tod [CHimethyimaleate were detected among the products
of {7-"Cjnictinate metabolism. When specifically lax
beled a-methylenegtatarate and dimethylmaleate were fer-
mented, the distribution of "C among the final products
(acetate, propionate, and carbon dioxide) was as predicted
‘from the earlier acer experiments. The carbory] carbon
of pyruvate is the most likely precursor of carbon dioxide in
the fermentation.
