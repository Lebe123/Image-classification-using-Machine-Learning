‘by dogs in an exposure system facilitating oral inhalation of the

jgarctte smoke. Deposition ofthe labeled cigarette smoke in the
dogs was measured by whole-body counting and analysis of blood
tnd excreta. Bromine 82 was the bes suited tracer. It could be
detected by whole-body counting for up to 9 days as compared
to 3 and 4 days for °K and Na, respectively. Blood levels of
Br could be monitored for 4 days. Excreta aso showed detect-
able levels of "Br for 4 days. Between 30 and 70% of the "Br
body burden occurred in the blood where it was retained for an
appreciable period of time. The "Br blood level was a linear
fanction of the number of cigaretics smoked whereas whole-body

‘F CIOARETTE swoKE is a primary etiological agent for the induc-
should
bbe possible to produce these diseases in suitable experimental
animals exposed to cigarette smoke by inhalation in a controlled
laboratory environment. A basic requirement for such experi-
‘ments is the administration of cigarette amoke to the experimental
‘method simulating the mechanisms of human ciga-
as closely as possible. In most experiments unnatural
methods have been used such as tracheal fistulas, smohe-filled
chamnbers resulting in nasal rather than oral inhalation of smoke,
and anesthetized animals, A method was developed in this lab-
oratory 0 facili ion of cigarette smoke by beagle
dogs to test the effect of smoking on clearance of inhaled radio-
active particles (2). Because this technique is being applied in
more extensive studies, it was desirable t© obtain further quanti-
‘ative data on the inhalation and deposition of smoke constituents
in the dog.

Preliminary experiments showed that cigaretie smoke can be
labeled with "Br, #Na, and €K by prior exposure of the cigarette
te neutron radiation. This raised the question whether these ra~
Sionuclides could be-detected in experimental animals smoking
neutron activated cigarettes. A series of experiments was initiated
of which a representative example is described in detail

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

‘The smoking system for dogs has been previously.

(8). In summary, the system comprises a face mask with a ciga-

reite holder, valves, and an electronic control system. The mask

‘contains a flattened polyethylene tube which extends 3.8.cm into

the dog's mouth, through which both air and smoke are inhaled.

‘The control system regulates frequency and. volume of the ciga-
reite smoke introduced into the mask, The dog, wearing the face
mask with the burning cigarette inserted in the cigarette holder,
inhales fresh aie through a solenoid valve connected to the flat
‘ened polyethylene tube inseried in the dog's mouth. A thermistor, = i
‘mounted in the air intake of the solenoid valve, “count” the =
number of inhalations. Afier a preselected number of respiratory
cycles, the solenoid valve close, causing the dog to inhale through
the cigarette. Inhalation through the cigarette is monitored by a
pressure transducer which triggers the reopening of the solenoid
valve afier a smoke bolus of predetermined volume has been in-
hhaled by the dog, allowing the dog to complete this particular
inhalation with fresh air through the reopened solenoid valve.
‘The apparatus thus simulates certain characteristics of humans
cigarette smoking mechanics; namely, the oral inhalation of a °°"):
sraoke bolus, completion of that particular inhalation with a”
volume of fresh air, followed by a nuinber of inhalations of fresh
air between each smoke inhalation. For the experiments de-
scribed in this paper, the smoke exposure system was set to de-
liver one 7-ml puff every sixth respiratory cycle. Dogs tolerate
the procedure well and ean be trained to smoke at a rate of about
20 cigarettes per 8-h period. : ’

‘The subjects were 2-yr-old female beagles raised in our colony.
During the experiments the dogs were housed in metabolism
‘ages. The weights of the dogs, numbered 392, 396, and 401,
were 11.4, 9.5, and 11.8 kg, respectively.
