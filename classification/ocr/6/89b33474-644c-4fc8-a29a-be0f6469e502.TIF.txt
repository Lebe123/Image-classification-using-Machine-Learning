Erective use of a health eare technique requires an accu
rate assessment of the specific technique and its benefits,
sks, costs, and alternatives as applied to specific problems
‘Such an assessment requires appiving the technique in var-
jed clinical situations and publishing the results in the medi
talliterature. De facto rationing of forms of technology suc
fs MEI under the banner of east containment impedes tech-
‘ology assessment and thovarts improvement in patient care
‘This ultimately costs sociery and patients dearly in terms of
delayed diagnoses, erroneous diagnoses, and meedless ther-
apis.

co smoke is about | ug per cubie meter. A person weighing
$0 ig with a deal volume of 4 ml per klogram of body
weight breathing 20 times per minute would exchange 5.6
Ties of air per minute. If we assume that nicotine is com-
pletely absorbed from the lungs, it would take 179 minutes,
Prstbout 3 hours, of breathing in an environment with mini-
fal smoke to absorb | wg of nicotine, Table 1 shows the
mount of each vegetable by wet weight one would have to
taro obiain an amount of nicotine comparable 1 that of
passive smoker, Of course, the route of absorption is quite
Biferen in eating as compared with inhaling, Furthermore,
{f the vegetables are thoroughly cooked, the nicotine wi
Gifure into the cooking water and less will be ingested. It
Spears tat the dietary intake of nicotine in nonsmokers
Te be of practical importance in the interpretation of the
Tule of pastve smoke inhalation when one is determining
bleating and cotinine levels in body Buds
