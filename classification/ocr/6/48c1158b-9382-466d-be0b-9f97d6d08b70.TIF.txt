‘The pharmacological actions of nicotine upon the central nervous syster
have been studied for many years by numerous investigators (Slvette «tal.
1962). It has not always been established, however, that nicotine acts directly
‘upon the central nervous system. In addition to systemic administration,
drugs have been introduced into the brain either by intracisternal or incra-
ventricular injection, or by microinjection into discrete regions. In the exper-
ments to be described, nicotine was injectad'into the cerebral ventricles of
conscious and of anesthetized cata through a Collison cannula implanted in «
lateral ventricle an described by Feldberg and Sherwood (1953). Injections
were made through « rubber diaphragm in the screw cap of the cannula. In
experiments upon cats anesthetized with chloralose (60-80 mg/kg intraven-
ously), nicotine was either injected intraventricularly, perfused! through the
carebral ventricles from a lateral ventricle to the Sylvian aqueduct, as de-
seribed by Bhattacharya and Feldberg (1968), or perfused through the sub-
arachnoid, space from the interpeduncular foasa to the cisterna magna,
according to the method of Beleslin, Polak, and Sproull (1965). Drugs in-
jected into, or perfused through the Collison cannula have access to the
‘whole ofthe lataral ventricle, enter the third ventricle through the foramen
of Monro, pas via the Sylvian aqueduct to the fourth ventricle and reach the
subarachnoid space through the foramina of Luschka in the lateral recesses.
Some of these structures are illustrated in FIGURE 1. The fourth ventricle and
subarachnoid space can be excluded from the perfusion by cannulation of the
Sylvian aqueduct with polyathylene tubing. Some of the results to be de-
scribed have been reported by Armitage, Milton, and Morrison (1966) and
Hall and Reit (1966).

 

Conscious Cats

Injected into the cerebral ventricles, nicotine produced various effects.
After 25-10 yp, there occurred blinking, narrowing of palpebral fissures,
etching, vomiting, and asynchronous twitching of the ears. The pinna reflex
was facilitated as well, After 30-100 ug, labored respiration also occurred,
followed by panting and salivation. The ear twitching was interrupted initially
for about 15 seconds, during which both ears were laid back. Sometimes there
