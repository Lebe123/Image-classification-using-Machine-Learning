Environmental Exposure to Tobacco Smoke and Lung
Function In Young Adults‘?

MARIA ARDITO MASI," JAMES A, HANLEY,

“The quality of indoor air (1) has emerged
‘as one of the principal bealth eoncems
(ofthe drive wo energy conservation (2),
‘particularly in northern latitudes where
‘harsh winter climate leads to strenu-
‘ous efforts to diminish the dissipation
‘ofbeat. Acommonandimportant source
‘of indoor pollution tobacco smoke. in
particular, cigarete smoke (2), and
Canada is among the world leadersin per
‘capita cigarete consumption (3). Adverse
tffecas of environmental exposure to
tobacco smoke, alto called passive smok-
fing, have been demonstrated in most
(4ri2) but not all (13-15) studies of lung
function in children. In adults, effects
‘have been inconsistently found, but they
may be more pronounced in subjects
‘older than 40 yr of age (16-20). Adverse
effects appear to be les readily demon
‘arable in warm dry climates (14,15, 21)
‘On balance, the evidence suggests dove.
relationships between exposure
[Bnd any adverse effect on lung function,
‘akhough estimates of exposure have been
far from quantitative (22, 23). The ob-
jective ofthe present study was to deter-
‘ine whether cumulative lifetime en-
‘Vironmpental exposure to tobacco smoke
fn the home and/or at work affects the
ung function of young adults 15 10 38
yr of age. This age group has not previ-
‘usly been the target of investigation, and
‘puch crost-tectional data as exist do not
point wo adverse ung function effects (16,

‘Sas made to develop a cumulative index

‘ive mature than the essentially qualitay
tive indices used previoutly.
