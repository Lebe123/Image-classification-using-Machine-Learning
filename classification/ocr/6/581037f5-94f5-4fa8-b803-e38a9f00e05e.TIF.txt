COLLECTION AND CHARACTERIZATION
OF AIRBORNE PARTICULATE MATTER
IN BUILDINGS

scrI0H

Increaning concern for the enviroment {0 vorking and living areas has accentuated the need fo
edequate Tenoval of perticulece matter {row the A{y eepplied to these areas, for

    

applications. Inforastion concerning the cheaical and physics
‘by indoor and intake afr handling and cleaning equipeen
formation of

peasurenente specific to the
ature of particulate matter carri
4a critteal to the desige of ait cleaning eystens and ia

tative cent duate used in laboratory evaluations teas. Both Labor
tory and field evalustions of air cleaning equipeent Tequite that a jmmpling and esalyoie
tachaiques be available. Ie 40 necessary, then, thet efficient methods be developed and evalv-
‘ated vBich allov convenient asseseneot of the iuportast cherecteristics of airborne particulate
fatter found ip indoor and intate air.

 

   

   
   

 

     

 

jaatly
tration of techoique suitability,
‘air-hindling aystens vere collected during each of
‘the four eaasons of the year and acalyzed for epecific particle characteristics

DEFINITIONS WO AULYEIS TECOQUES

‘Tee experinental date obtained with any techalque for assessing particle characteriatice are
dependent, to some degree, on the epecitic technique employ. ther, any particle charace
terietic in mubject £0 some uncertainties and co arbitrary choices regarding the nature of the
Anforuation to be included an representing that pacific charecteriatic . Therefore, particle

ica wont be defined as explicitly aad’ an independently of experiaental techniques,
however, 1¢ must be recopsised that definitions of some particle eharacteristicn
‘Mist reflect the nature end Laitetions of experimental procedures,

 

   

 

   

‘Tee particle eheracteriatics of interest ia this study were apectfically:

(Q) Total mass concentration of airborne particles .
(2) Percentage and sine of ary granular eeterial
@Q) Percentage nd site of fibrous seterial
(6) Percentage ead size of Liguid/organte aerosols
(3) Pree carbon costest of particles
() Matan oxise content of perticles
(0) Total orgente content of pareieles
(@) Klecerteal conductivity of dust deposit.
Because the definitions of these particle characteristics and the methods for their messuremeat
sare closely related, they vill be dlacussed together for each characteristic.
