Matched normal/tumor DNA pairs from sporadic colon carcinoma
patients were examined for chromosome 5 allele loss using a probe
for a functional gene (glucocorticoid receptor=GRL) locus. This
locus maps (5Sgll-ql3) close to one of two alternative sites
recently reported for a constitutional deletion in a familial
adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patient. Tumor-specific allele loss of
at least 27% at GRE supports the hypothesis that both hereditary
and sporadic forms of colon cancer result from mutations of the
same gene. The proximity of the GRL locus to the region of 5q
affected in FAP and the observed tumor-specific allele loss at this
locus suggest that further research is needed regarding whether
genetic alterations in the glucocorticoid receptor may be
associated with colon carcinogenesis. © 1s acssone press, ine

on the basis of the clinical genetic features of hereditary
vs. sporadic forms of colorectal cancer (1) we suspected that both
forms of this disease might result from mutations of the same gene
caused by a two-step mechanism similar to that which occurs in the
etiology of retinoblastoma and Wilms' tumors (2). Employing the
same molecular genetic approach that was used to substantiate the
occurrence of this mechanism in these childhood cancers (3), we

examined normal vs. tumor DNA from each patient for tumor-specific
