Many proteins involved in signal transduction have been
shown to contain three conserved domains. designated the
'SH3. SH2. and SH2" domains (SH represents arc homology)
or the A. B. and C boxes, respectively (34, 40, 49). These
domains. which we will refer to simply as SH2/3. were frst
found among non-receptor-iype tyrosine kinases (4B). and
they were subsequently identifed in the e7k oncogene prod
LUct (34). "phosphatidylinositol- specific phospholipase
(PLC) (12, 49, 50). 705 GTPase activator protein (GAP) (82

Drotcins. some of which are associated with the membrane
cytoskeleton (11. 27. 28, 30. 45. 31. 94, $8. 8).

Fecent studies have shown that some mutations in the SHS
domain may activate the transforming potential oF
which is otherwise nontransforming (17. 39). Mutatvons i
