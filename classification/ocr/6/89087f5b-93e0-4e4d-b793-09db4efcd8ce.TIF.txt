“Asian Cigarette” is an Adverse
Prognostic Factor in Peripheral
Arterial Disease

In parts of South East Asia physicians believe that the steong,
inexpensive locally made cigarettes are a risk factor in the
evelopment of peripheral arterial disease. Thus, in Ceylon the
young men who smoke Beedi cigarettes are said to be par.
ticularly prone to occlusive diseases of the small arteries,
A study of the Buerger syndrome in Korea revealed that the
patients smoked a coarse form of locally grown tobacco". In
other parts of Asia where the Buerger syndrome has been
described the disease predominates inthe lowest socio-economic
groups (N. K. Yong, personal communication, and refs 3 and
4). Presumably, these poor people smoke the locally grown
‘and locally manufactured cigarettes most often since they are
the cheapest available

In a recent epidemiological study of a large number of
patients with the Buerger syndrome in Indonesia the patients
Were found 10 smoke cigarettes of three basic types*. The
commonest was *Kawung’, the tobacco of which is grown,

with cloves and spices and wrapped in a normal tissue as used
in Western cigarettes. “Western’-type cigarettes were also
‘smoked by these poor patients as were also conglomerates of
tobacco removed from discarded cigarette butts and remanuc
factured by some enterprising merchant.

Because there was no information’ available about the
smoking habits of the controls at a time comparable to the
onset of the disease in the patients they were matched with,
We are not able to comment on the Kawing cigarette as a risk
factor.

In Fig. Ty however, a state flow chart describes the expected
clinical course for 100 Indonesian patients with Buerger's
disease who smoked Kawung cigarettes, and compares it with
the expected clinical course for 100 patients who smoked:
Kretek cigarettes, Western cigarettes or a combination of these
two. At each time interval, during the course of the disease for
the group of patients, Kavung cigarettes are associated with a
worse prognosis. The state flow chart is derived feom a
‘mathematical model of Buerger's disease and the theoretical
aspeats are detailed elsewhere.

Although we found that Kawung smoking was associated
witha low socio-economic status, which in itself was found to
bean adverse prognostic fuctor, it was also found that Kawung,
smokers of higher socio-economic status had just as poor a
prognosis as Kawung smokers of low socio-economic status.
