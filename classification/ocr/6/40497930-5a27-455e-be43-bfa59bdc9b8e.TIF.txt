sumMARY | Nerves containing peptides that supply the human intrapulmonary vasculature were
studied in 21 controls aged one month to 24 years and in 13 patients with pulmonary hypertension,
aged 11 days to cight years. An indirect immunofluorescence technique was used to study the
distribution and relative density of nerve fibres containing the general ncuronal marker, protein
gene product 9'5; tyrosine hydroxylase; synaptophysin; neuropeptide tyrosine; vasoactive
intestinal polypeptide; substance P, somatostatin; and calcitonin gene related peptide. Atall ages in
normal and hypertensive lungs neuropeptide tyrosine was the predominant neuropeptide
associated with the pulmonary vascular nerves. In normal lungs the relative density of nerve fibres
increased during childhood only in the arteries of the respiratory unit. Pulmonary hypertension
‘was associated with the premature innervation of these arteries during the first year of lif.
Innervation of small, abnormally thick-walled pre-capillary vessels by predominantly vasocon-
strictor nerves may help to explain the susceptibility of infants to pulmonary hypertensive crises.

  

‘There is no reliable effective medical treatment for
pulmonary hypertension. Children with potentially
reversible pulmonary vascular disease can die after a
‘technically successful intracardiac repair because of
the development of pulmonary hypertensive crises
that become intractable to al forms of treatment
Pharmacolological management of pulmonary
hypertension might be improved by understanding.
how the pulmonary vasculature is innervated in such

tion of contractile myoflaments increases and the

bby an increase in the density of presumed sympath-
etic nerves.* Experimental studies showed trophic
interactions between sympathetic nerves and vas-
colar smooth muscle cells?

‘The adult human pulmonary vasculature is
innervated by noradrenergic and cholinergic
nerves” bur these nerves also contain other putative
transmitters, including several vasoactive peptides,
which may have a regulatory role in the pulmona
circulation. Examples of such peptides identified in
‘mammalian pulmonary nerves include vasoactive
intestinal polypeptide (predominantly in parasyr

nerve fibres), substance P and the ni
kinins! and calcitonin gene related peptide” (all
present in sensory nerve fibres), and neuropeptide
tyrosine" (in sympathetic fibres) as recently re-
viewed by Lundberg eta.

We used immunocytochemical techniques to
examine the innervation of the pulmonary vas-
culature in the normal and pulmonary hypertensive
‘human lung. The overall pattern of innervation was
studied with an antiserum to general neuronal cyto-
plasmic marker, protein gene product 95. Specific
subpopulations of nerve fibres wete identified by

ies to nevropeptides and to the enzyme
tyrosine hydroxylase which synthesises  cate-
cholamines.
