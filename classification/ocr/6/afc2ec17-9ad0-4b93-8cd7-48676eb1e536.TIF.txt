parasite-sensitized rats. Am J. Physiol, 258 (Heatt Cire. Phys:
fol. 27): H1126-HLLSL, 1990,—Thirty days after infection with
the parasite Nipposérongyius brasiliensis, microcirculatory
changes associaced with worm allergen-induced anaphylactic
shock in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats were studied. Allergen
‘challenge decreased heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure,
‘and cardiac output (CO) for 60 min, although CO increased
markedly by 240 min. Blood flow (ml-min"™-g wet tissue")

duced to most tissues, with the exception of the kidneys,
hepatic arterial, heart, and brain, for 60 mir. Depressed flow
to the adrenals and enhanced flow to the kidneys, trachea,
stomach, and mesentery were observed at 40 min. The percent
distribution of eardiac output per gram wet tissue (%CO/g)
inezeased initially to the kidneys, heart, liver, and cervical
spinal cord, decteased to the spleen and cocura, and remained
unchanged to other gastrointestinal tissues. ‘The %CO/g to
‘most tissues returned to normal by 60 min but decreased to the
adrenals at 240 min, ‘The intestine is an important organ
affected by anaphylaxis inthe rat, and the liver may participate
in alleviating anaphylaxis.

ANAPHYLAXIS is an immediate type of allergic reaction
that ean induce either a local response in a sensitive
tissue or organ or a systemic anaphylaxis, which precip-
itates circulatory collapse and life-threatening shock. A
‘common feature of anaphylaxis among different species
is respiratory distress and asphyxia (9), although species-
specific dysfunctions of other organs have been noted
Early studies of Sanyal and West (25) identified the
intestine as the primary organ affected by anaphylaxis
in the rat as marked hemorrhaging was observed. Species
differences in the organs affected by anaphylaxis occur
with right heart failure taking place in the rabbit (1),
and hepatic congestion occurring in the dog (1, 15)

Rats that have been infected with the nematode Nip-
postronaylus brasiliensis exhibit elevated concentrations
Of parasite-specific immunoglobulin antibodies (5). The
intestine is the main organ affected by anaphylaxis in
the sensitized rat when the rat is exposed to a single
infection of N. brasiliensis (16, 17, 20). Repeated expo-
ssure to the parasite, however, results in a transition from
intestine to lung as the primary organ affected by ana-
phylaxis organ (16, 17). When the rat is exposed to a
single infection, mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils

are recruited to the intestinal mucosa (12), although
immune and inflammatory responses occur elsewhere,
€.. the trachea, spleen, and the lungs (2). Although the
integrity of the intestine may be primarily affected dur-
ing anaphylaxis, other as yet unidentified tissues may
participate in and contribute to development of the shock
syndrome.

In an attempt. to more precisely define tissues that
participate in a systemic anaphylactic response in the
rat, we determined blood flow to a variety of tissues and.
organs in animals that had previously heen sensitized to
N- brasiliensis, We used radiolabeled microspheres to
‘measure regional blood flow changes, a technique that
has been applied successfully to the monkey (26) and the
dog (15, 29) to study changes in the cardiovascular sys-
tem associated with anaphylaxis

  

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Breeding
Laboratories, Canada) of an initial weight of 200-250 ¢
were maintained in filter-top cages (2-3 per cage) to
minimize the possibility of other infections

Animals were infected subcutaneously in the scruff of
the neck with 3,000 third stage infective larvae of Nip-
postrongylus brasiliensis. The larvae were collected from
fecal cultures (2) and extensively washed before injec-
tion. Thirty to 35 days after the initial sensitization, the
anaphylactic reaction was initiated by an intravenous

jection (via the penile vein with a 27-gauge needle)
with 100 l of antigen containing 150 worm equivalents
of homogenized N. brasiliensis,

Previous studies have established that most of the
worms are expelled from the animal by 2 wk after infec-
tion (30). To control for the effects of a residual parasitic
infection on regional blood flows, a group of infected rats
(n= 5) was treated with the anthelmintic agent thiaben-
dazole (Thibenzole, Merck, Sharp & Dohme) given at 80
mg/kg in aqueous suspension by stomach tube (13)
Seven days after treatment with the deworming agent,
blood flows and percent distribution of cardiac output
(CO) were examined at 5 min after antigen challenge.

Hemodynamics were studied 10 min before injecting
antigen and at three time points (5, 60, and 240 min)
after intravenous injection of antigen. Separate groups
of rats were used for the three time points studied,
Anesthesia was induced before surgery with intraperito-
neal pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg body wt) and main-
