‘The relation between parents’ tobacco smoking prior to beth and cancer inthe

‘ous studies, and increased risks of adverse
pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous
abortion, low birth weight, preterm delivery,
and perinatal death, have been reported (1)
Biochemical measurements of cigarette
smoke constituents in the placenta (2), am-
niotic fluid (3-5), and fetal blood (6, 7) of
bboth actively and passively smoking mothers
demonstrate the transplacental passage of
cigarette smoke constituents. Two exposure
pathways therefore determine fetal exposure
1o cigarette smoke: the mother's smoking
during pregnancy and her exposure to smok-
ing by others in the home (e8., the child's
father, other household members) or outside
the home (e.., at the workplace)

Prenatal exposure 10 mother's cigarette
smoking may also increase the risk of cancer
in the offspring. Associations with maternal
smoking during pregnancy have been re-
ported for all childhood cancers combined
