INTRODUCTION lung. On the other hand, it is well documented that
vitamin A (retinol) and its derivatives are involved
in the differentiation and maintenance of the proper

The objective of this research was to determine

whether or not mainstream and sidestream cigarette

Cigarette smoking has been implicated in the patho-
genesis of various types of pulmonary diseases.'"* In
Addition, a recent study indicated that nonsmokers who
are exposed to smoke in the houschold suffer from

 

 

alterations in lung function.* Recent studies also sug-
gest that there is & small but consistent increased risk
‘of lung cancer from passive smoke exposure.*

‘We have recently reported that cigarette smoke ex-
posure causes an increase in the free radical-mediated
lipid peroxidation potential of erythrocytes in guinea
pigs under both mainstream and sidestream condi-
tions It is possible that the increase in lipid peroxida-
tion of erythrocytes in smoke-exposed animals is asso-
ciated with the inability of the erythrocytes to quench
the free radicals because of deficiency of some antioxi-
dants. In fact, lower levels of carotene and vitamin C
hhave been reported in plasma of smokers."*

Currently, i is not known whether cigarette smoke
exposure causes alterations in the vitamin A status in

smoke exposure causes modulation in the retinol con-
tent of plasma, lung, lung lavage, and liver. As some
metabolic characteristics in guinea pigs, such as, for
example, those of lung surfactant development, are
‘more similar to humans than in other experimental
animals," guinea pigs were used as animal model.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals

Male guinea pigs (Hartley strain), 3 weeks of age,
weighing 275~300 g were obiained from Camm Re-
search Laboratories, New Jersey. Animals were di-
vided into four groups: Group RC maintained as room,
control, Group SH maintained as sham control, Group
MS maintained as mainstream smoke-exposed, and
Group SS maintained as sidestream smoke-exposed.
