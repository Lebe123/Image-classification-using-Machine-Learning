Identification of a Cysteine Residue Essential for Activity of Protein
Farnesyltransferase

Cys®° IS EXPOSED ONLY UPON REMOVAL OF ZINC FROM TH

 

NZYME,

Protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) is a zinc met-
alloenzyme that performs a post-translational modifica
tion on many proteins that is critical for their function.
The importance of eysteine residues in FTase activity
was investigated using eysteine-specifie reagents. Zine
depleted FTase (apo-FTase), but not the holocnzyme,
‘was completely inactivated by treatment with N-othy!
maleimide (NEM). Similar effects were detected after
treatment of the enzyme with iodoacetamide. The addi
tion of zinc to apo-F"Tase protects it from inactivation by
NEM. These findings indicated the presence of specific
yateine rosidue(s), potentially located at the zine bind:
ing site, that are required for FTase activity. We per-
formed a selective labeling strategy whereby the eys-
teine residues exposed upon removal of zine from the
enzyme were modified with (HJNEM. The enzyme so *
modified was digested with trypsin, and four labeled
fied and sequenced, one peptide
Being the major site of labeling and the rema
Inbeled to lesser extents. The major labeled peptide con-
tained a radiolabeled cysteine residue, Cys”, that is in

 

  

    

 

 

   

 

 

 

  

teins retained the ability to bind farnesy! diphosphate,
they were found to have lost essentially all catalytic
activity and ability to bind rine. These results indicate
that the Cys in the B subunit of FTase plays a critical
role in catalysis by the enzyme and is likely to be one of,
the residues that directly coordinate the zine atom in
this enzyme.
