Summary

‘AcDNA clone encoding a novel, widely expressed pro-
tein (called growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 or
GRE2) containing one sre homology 2 (SH2) domain
‘and two SHS domeins was Isolated. Immunoblotting
‘experiments indicate that GRB2 associates with
tyrosine-phosphorylated epidermal growth factor re-
ceptors (EGFRs) and platelet-derived growth factor re-
ceptors (PDGFRs) via its SH2 domain, Interestingly,
GAB2 exhibits striking structural and functional ho-
mology to the C. elegans protein sem-s. It has been
shown that semr5 and two other genes called let-29,
(EGFR like) and Jet 60 (ras like) lle along the same sig-
nal transduction pathway controling. elegans vulval
Induction. To examine whether GAB2 is also a compo-
‘nent of ras signaling in mammalian cells, micrainjec-
tion studies were performed. White injection of GRE2
(of Has proteins alone into quiescent rat fibroblasts
did not have mitogenic effect, microinjection of GRE2
together with Hae protein stimulated DNA synthesis
‘These results suggest that GRB2/sem-S plays acrucial
role in a highly conserved mechanism for growth fac
tor control of ras signaling.

 

Introduction

Polypeptide growth factors meciato their physiological re-
sponses by binding oand acvatingcol surface receptors
with intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activities (reviewed in
Ulich and Schlessinger, 1990) Both receptor activation
‘and yrosine autophosphoryation wore shown tobe med

josterie Intermolacular process (reviewed in
1968). Receptor autophosphorylation ap-
‘pears to bo essential for association witha group of cyto
plasmic target protain (reviewed in Koch et al, 1991;
Heldin, 1981; Margols, 1982). Following binding, cortin
target proteins. such as phospholipase C-y (PLO-) be-
‘come tyfosine phosphorylated and activated (Me'sen-
elder etal, 1989; Wah at al, 1969; Margolis et a, 1989;
Kazlauskas and Cooper, 1889; Kim st al, 1991). Other

 

 

target proteins, such as phosphoinositide (P19) kinase.
associated p85, function as adaptors or regulatory sub-
‘nits to couple tyrosine kinase receptors to effector pro-
‘sine (Cantey etal, 1991; Hu etal, 1992; MeGlade ot al.
1992).

The assoc'ation between signaling proteins and growth
factor receptors strictly dependent upon tyrosine phos-
phoryaton of specific short sequence motifs. short con:
‘sensus sequonce was described inthe kinase insert r6-
‘gon of the platelet-derived growth factor (POGF) and
colony-stimulaing factor 1 receptors and shown to act as.
binding site for PL3 kinase-associated p85 (Kaziauskas
‘and Cooper, 1990; Cantley ot al, 1991; Escobedo otal,
19912; Reed etal, 1982). Another sequence moti was.

(Margolis ot al.,1990a, 19900; Mohammadi et a, 1991,
1992; Rotin et al, 1992a). These autophosphoryation
sites in growth factor receptors represent recognition
tructue® for speci target proteins containing sre ho:
mology 2 (SH2} domains. SH2 domains are conserved
‘sequences of approximately 100 2a found in various sig
‘naling molecules and oncogenic proteins (reviewed in
Koch et al, 1997; Heidin, 1991; Margolis, 1992). SH2 do-
mains have been found in a diverse group of proteins,
‘some containing enzymatic activities, such a5 PLC,
‘GTP ase-actvating protein, and pp6o"™ (Stan ota, 1988
‘Suh etal, 1988; Sadowsk ta, 1988; Vogel etal, 1988;
Trahy et al., 1988), while others, such as nck, vcrk, and
185 (Lehmann etal, 1990; Mayer etl, 1988, 1982; Sol
niketal, 1991; Otsu et al, 1991: Escobedo etal, 1991b).
lack any apparent enzymatic activity. Binding of SH2 co-
‘mains to tyrosine-phosphoryated regions of growth factor
receptors is thought to provid a common mechanism by
‘which dverse enzymaticandreguiatory protelns caninter-
‘act specially with growth factor receptors and thereby
‘couple growth factor stimulation to multpl intracellular
signaling pathways (reviewed in Koch et al, 1991; Heldin,
1991; Margolis, 1992). SH2 damalns are often accompa-
nied bya stretch of conserved sequence at approximately
0a, termed SH3 domain, whose unctionisnotcutrently
