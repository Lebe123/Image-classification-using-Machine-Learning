CRITIQUE

Justice, Science, and the “Bad Guys”

When accused of a new offense, does someone
regarded asa “bad guy" have the right to due process
and a fair trial? If such a right is inberent in the legal
systems of civilized society, isitalso a pant of justice
in the “courts” of scientific evaluation? I ask these
questions because, in private conversation, I re-
cently heard an authoritative leader in the world of
public health epidemiology make the following
statement: “Yes, it's rotten science, but it's in a
‘worthy cause. It will help us get rid of cigarettes and
become a smoke-free society.”

‘The statement, of course, referred to the data and
‘evaluations assembled in the past few years for ac-
cusations about what is formally called environ-
‘mental tobacco smoke and informally designated as
passive smoking. According to the accusations, this,
type of exposure causes at least 2 of the prime evils
hitherto attributed to direct smoking: lung cancer
and cardiovascular disease. In fact, several of the
recent cardiovascular studies found risks that were
even higher for passive smokers than for direct
smokers. (The authors tactfully refrained, however,
from stating the implicit conclusion that people who
cannot avoid passive exposure should lower their
risk by beginning to smoke directly.)

  

A new part of the current indictment is the claim
‘that passive smoking is responsible for respiratory
and otologic difficulties in children. Because young
children so rarely engage in direct smoking, pedia-
tricians have hitherto had little participation in the
research industry devoted to studying cigarettes.
Now, with open hunting season declared on the ef-
fects of passive smoking in children, a fertile new
opportunity has arisen for selfless public service,
fame, grants, and publications.

‘Nevertheless, if the science is as “rotten” as the
public health authority admitted, does the end really
Justify the means? If objectivity, precautions against
bias, and careful operating guidelines are essential
for a “bad guy” to get fair treatment in a court of
law, should those principles be abandoned or abol-
ished when the “bed guy” is in a court of science?

A peripheral inspection, without any in-depth ap-
praisals, of the current accusations about passive
smoking would suggest that many scientific prin-
ciples have vanished. I shall cite 3 overt examples:

1) Many of the pediatric researchers seem un-
‘aware of the frequent disparity between symptoms
and objective evidence ofailmeats whenever people
are passively exposed to a “bad guy.” Perhaps the
mont striking demonstration of this phenomenon
