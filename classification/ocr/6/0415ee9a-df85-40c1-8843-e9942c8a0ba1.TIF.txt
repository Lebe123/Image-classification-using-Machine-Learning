Differential Desensitization of A, Adenosine
Receptor-Mediated Inhibition of Cardiac
Myocyte Contractility and Adenylate
Cyclase Activity
Relation to the Regulation of Receptor Affinity and Density

Bruce T. Liang and Leslie A. Donovan

Effects of chronic exposure of cultured atrial myocytes to R-N*-(2-phenylisopropyl)-adenosine
(APIA) on the A, adenosine receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity and
myocyte contractility were examined. Chronic exposure of atrial myocytes cultured trom
14-day-old chick embryos to R-PIA desensitized the myocyte to the inhibitory effects of R-PIA,
‘on contractility and adenylate cyclase activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner.
Desensitization of the negative inotropic response was only partial, whereas the adenosine
receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity was almost completely absent after 24
hours of R-PIA (1 1M) exposure, Furthermore, the contractile response to K-PIA desensitized
‘more slowly than the desensitization of A, adenosine receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate
cyclase (f;;=11.4:0.7 hours versus 7.5:+1 hours, mean SEM, n=12 and 6, respectively). Thus,
the two A, adenosine receptor-tinked functional responses desensitized differently in response
to chronic exposure of the myocyte to R-PIA. Binding of the antagonist radioligand ['H)-
8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (UHICPX) in membranes from myocytes preexposed to
R-PIA demonstrated a time-dependent decrease in receptor density without any change in the
affinity for the antagonist radioligand. Computer analyses of agonist competition with ['H]CPX
binding in membranes from control and R-PIA-treated myocytes revealed a conversion of the
high-affinity A, adenosine receptor to a low-affinity form such that after 24 hours of 1 M R-PIA
‘exposure, all of the receptors were in a low-affinity form, On the other hand, downregulation of
the receptor was partial, with nearly 60% of the receptor remaining after 24-hour treatment
with 1 4M R-PIA. These data indicate that the mechanism of desensitization of the A,
adenosine receptor-mediated negative inotropic response differs from that of the desensitiza-
tion of the adenylate cyclase. Uncoupling of the A, adenosine receptor from a high-affinity state
‘was closely associated with desensitization of the inhibition of adenylate cyclase; downregula-
tion of the A; adenosine receptor appeared to parallel desensitization of the negative inotropic
response, (Cireulation Research 1990;67:406~414)

‘A, adenosine receptors are present on spontaneously
contracting cultured atrial myocytes and are nega-
tively coupled to adenylate cyclase and to myocyte
contractility.* Pretreatment of intact chick embryo
with R-N"(2-phenylisopropyl)-adenosine (R-PIA)
resulted in downregulation of the A, adenosine
receptor and a concomitant desensitization of R-
PIA-induced antagonism of forskolin-stimulated
positive inotropic response in embryonic chick ven-
tricular slices.!° Chronic subcutaneous administra-
tion of R-PIA also attenuated adenosine receptor-
mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity in
rat adipose tissues.!" However, the concentration of
R-PIA to which the chick ventricle and rat adipose
tissue in the intact animal were exposed is not known.
