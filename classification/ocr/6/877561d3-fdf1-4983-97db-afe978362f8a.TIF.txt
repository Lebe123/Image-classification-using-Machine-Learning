‘About half of human conceptions are estimated not to be
Implanted in the uterus, resulting In unrecognizable
spontaneous abortions", and about 5% of human births
hhave a recognizable malformation’ In order to find clues
to the mechanisms of malformation and abortion, we
compared the incidences of radlation-Induced malforma-
tions and abortions in p53 null (p53) and wild-type
(p53"*) mice. After Kitradiation with 2 Gy on day 9.3 of
Gestation, p53” mice showed a 70% incidence of
anomalies and a 7 Incidence of deaths, whereas p53"
mice had 2 20% Incidence of anomalies and a 60%
Incidence of deaths. Similar results were obtained after
inradiation on day 3.5 of gestation. This reciprocal
relationship of radiosensitivity to anomalies and to
embryonic or fetal lethality supports the notion that
embryonic or fetal Ussues have a p53-dependent
“guardian” of the tissue that aborts cells bearing
radlatlor-induced teratogenic ONA damage. In fact, after
Xirradiation, the number of cells with apoptotic DNA
fragments was greatly increased in tissues of the p53"
fetuses but not in those of the p53” fetuses,
