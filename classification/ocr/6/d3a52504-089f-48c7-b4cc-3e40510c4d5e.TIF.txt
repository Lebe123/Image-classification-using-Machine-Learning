The drug lag: An update of new drug
introductions in the United States
and in the United Kingdom, 1977
through 1987

“This report updates previous caudies that documented the exlsrence of a significant lag between new dng
incroduesons ia the United Kingdom snd in the United States. During the LL-yeas period from 1977
through 1987, the United Kingsiom led the United Sates in the mumber of frst introductions of new
rugs (L14 versus 41), in average load me for munually available drags (60.7 vereus 28.9 month). and
ludhenumber of exclusively available drugs (70 vernus 64). Analysis by therapeutic category indicated large
United Kingdom leeds in the introduction of respiratory (6.1 years), cardiovasculac (3.2 years), central
nervous system (3.2 years) and ant-eancer (2.9 yest) agents and shotter leads for anestherizand analgesic
(2.0 year), gustroiarertcal (2.0 peat), endocrina (14 years), and sativinfective (0.8 yeaes) agents A
comparison of the 5-year petiod from 1983 through 1987 wth the previous 6-year period (1978 throught
1982) showed no change inthe lengeh of the lag time (1.9 years for each peviod), These results indicate
thar the Uniced Stare continues to Lag behlad the United Kingdom in the availablity of new drugs.

(Over the past two decades, the development of new
drug therapies has failed to keep pace with rapid s¢-
‘vaneas in biomedical knowledge. The slow rate of phas-
‘maceutieal innovation in the United Statcs has often
teen attributed in par to the overly cautious regulation,
‘of new drugs by the Food and Drug Administration
(EDA) and to the slow and increasingly costly drug,
development process."
