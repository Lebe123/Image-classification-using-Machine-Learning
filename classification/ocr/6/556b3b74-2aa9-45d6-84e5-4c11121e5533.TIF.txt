CHEMOPROPHYLAXIS OF
INGOCOCCAL CARRIERS

Fox over 20 years sulfadiazine was a model pro-
phylaetic agent: ‘din closed populations,
small amonuts of sulfonamide drugs interrupted
transmission of meningococel by eradicating the
foryanism from the nasopharynges of asymptomatic
carriers, who are the source of most ineningococe

nesses, With the development and spread of
sulfonamide-resistaint strains several years ago this
era of tranquillity came lo an abrupt’end. ‘The most
recent data show that sullonamide-resistant meni
now account for over 70 per ‘cent of the
cases of meningococcal Iaeteremia and
meningitis! At present no other chemoprophylaeticr
ding has proved cipable of preventing meningacoe-
cal disease of transmission, although penielllin ix

contacts of patients with meningitis. The report by
Daal and Sanders in this issue of the Journal offers

fen orally fur four days to 15 chronle carriers was
effective in enidicathay meningococei from the phar

‘These observations need to be confirmed and ex-
tended, but even at this staue it is apparent that the
use of rifampin as a chetnoprophylactic agent will
have to be limited in scope, The lack of extensive
knowledge conceming toxie effects of the antibiotic

‘THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE,

 

Sept. 18, 1969

resistance to rifampin was not observed in the 1
oecal carrier strains that were eradicated.
Failures of rifumpin treatment of bacteriuria were
frequent in the studies of Aas and Turck

associated with the development of resista
to the drug (Esch. coli, pseudomonas and Proteus
mirabilis)

‘Thus, because of this experience with other bac-
toria, i€ is possible that large-scale use of
for meningococeal prophylaxis — for example, in
military training centers ~ would result inthe
emergence and spread of resistant neisierial organs
isms. The limited use of rifampin prophylaxis for
the relatively few close contacts of civilian patients,
with meningacoccemia would entail much less of a
risk of mutation to resistanze. Further experimental
work is ne-essary, however, before even this use ef
rifampin for prophylaxis ean be properly evaluates.
