There is an abundant indirect evidence indicating that ctr-
culating bradykinin and angiotensin I are metabolized by enzymes
situated along the luminal surface of pulmonary endothelial cells
(for reviews, sve Ryan,et 01., 1970a, 1972a & b: Smith & Ryan,
4973; Ryan & Ryan, 1973). The metabolism of bradykinin results in
loss of biological activity, but the activity of angiotensin I is .
enhanced, in part by Conversion to its Tover homolog, angiotensin
1}. Recently, Dorer,ct a1. (1972, 1974a) have succeeded in 1501 a-
ting an enzyne (angiotensin converting enzyme or kininase 11) from
pig lung which has the capacity of metabolizing angiozensin I and
bradykinin to produce metabolites like those prod ced by intact
Jungs: The enzyme converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II by re—
leasing the C-terminal dipeptide, His-Leu, and inactivates brady
Kinin by releasing the C-terminal dipeptide, Phe-Arg (cf Ryan, et
21. 5 1969, 19702 & b, 1971). Furthermore, the enzyme shows the v
sake selectivity of metabolism as was observed with intact lung:
mone of the higher homologs of bradykinin is inactivated as fact as
is bradykinin itself (Ryan,et al., 1970a; Roblero,et al. , 1973:
forer,et al-, 1974). Inactivation of the honologs appears to vary
‘inversely with size and charge.

 

   

 

We have prepared antibodies to pure preparations of the pig
lung enzyme and hve begun to use the antibodies to localize he
gellular and subcellular site(s) of the enzyme in intact lungs and
$m pulmonary endothet jal cells in culture (see Ryan, U.S, €F alee
