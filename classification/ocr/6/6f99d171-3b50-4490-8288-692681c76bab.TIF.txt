ABSTRACT Tobacco plants were genetically transformed
with the gene encoding hepatitis B surface antigen (HBSAg)
linked to a nominally constitutive promoter. Enzyme-linked
Immunoassays using a monoclonal antibody directed against
hboman serum-derived HBsAg revealed the presence of HBsAg
im extracts of transformed leaves at levels that correlated with
‘mRNA abundance. This suggests that there were no major
‘inherent limitations of transcription or translation of this
foreign gene in plans. Recombinant HBsAg was purified from
‘transgenic plants by immunoaffinity chromatography and ex-
amined by electron microscopy. Spherical particles with an
average diameter of 22 nm were observed in negatively stained
preparations. Sedimentation of transgenic plant extracts in
swerose and cesium chloride density gradients showed that the
recombinant HBsAg and human seruoderived HBsAg had
similar physical properties. Because the HBsAg produced in
transgenic plants is antigenically and physically similar to the
HBsAg particles derived from human serum and recombinant
‘yeast, which are used as vaccines, we conclude that transgenic
plants hold promise as low-cost vaceine production systems,

  

Hepatitis B virus infection is one of the most widespread viral
infections of humans and causes acute and chronic hepatitis
and hepatocellular carcinoma (1). The infectious viral particle
(Dane particle) isa 43-nm double-shelled sphere that consists
of a core containing the 3.2-kilobase (kb) DNA genome
‘bound to the core protein, surrounded by the viral envelope
containing phospholipids and the major surface antigen [hep-
atitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)] (2). In addition to Dane
particles, the serum of infected individuals also contains
22-nm subbvral particles in great excess over virions. These
‘noninfectious particles contain the elements of the viral
envelope, including the major 24-kDa peptide that occurs in
alycosylated and unglycosylated forms (2).

‘Because the host range of hepatitis B virus is limited to
humans and chimpanzees, and since the virus cannot be
propagated in cell culture, HBsAg for use in vaccines was
purified from the serum of infected ingividuals until a recom-
binant form (rHBsAg) was produced in yeast (3). The immu:
nogenic yeast-derived rHBsAg occurs in the form of spher
ical particles with an average diameter of 17 nm. Integration
‘of the peptides into the phospholipid-containing particles
greatly enhances their immunogenic properties (4). Subse-
quent work showed that the peptides present in the yeast
derived particles were much less extensively disulfide-linked
than ia the human material but that such linking could be
induced in vitro (5).

Intramuscular injection of serum-derived HBsAg or yeast-
derived rHBsAg in healthy individuals results in effective
immunization and protection from viral infection (6, 7). In
‘many areas of the developing world, however, the expense of
imanization programs for large segments of the population

is prohibitive, ‘his has led us to attempt the expression of
HBsAg in plants vith the hope of developing a less expen-
sive production system. Further, we hope to find a way to
present the rHBsAx in edible plant tissues in a form that
‘would be useful as un oral vaccine. In this paper we describe
the transformation of bacco withthe gene encoding HBsAg
and its expression in leaf tissue in the form of an antigenic
spherical particle with an average diameter of 22 am. This
plant-derived rHBsAg is directly analogous to the rHBsAg
from yeast that is now used for commercial vaccines. We
view this as a successful first step in a long-term project
dedicated to developing technologies for low cost “edible
vaccines” for the developing work.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Construction of Plasmids for Plant Transformation. The
HBsAg coding region on the Pst 1/Hindlll fragment from
PMT-SA (kindly provided by Liche Guo, Chinese Academy
fof Sciences) was subcloned into pBluescript KS (Stratagene)
to form pKS-HBS. The HBsAg gene in pKS-HBS was
‘opened 116 base pairs (bp) 3 to the termination codon with
BsiBI and the resalting ends were blunted by filing with
Klenow enzyme und dCTP/AGTP. The entire coding region
was then excised 16 bp upstream ofthe PstI site with BamHI

pBII21 (ref. 8; obtained from Clontech) was digested with
Sac I and the ends were blunted with mung bean nuclease

‘The GUS coding region was then released with Bamlil and
the vector was isolated. The HBsAg coding fragment was
ligated into the GUS-less pBI21 to yield pHBIO1 (Fig. 1),
where its expression is driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus
(CaMV) promoter derived from pBI21,

‘The CaMV 355 promoter with duplicated enhancer linked
to the tobacco eich virus (TEV) 5* nontransiated leader
sequence, which acts as a translational enhancer (9), was
excised from pRTT 2-GUS (10) as follows. pRTL2-GUS was
digested with Neo { and the ends were blunted with mung
bean nuclease. The promoter-leader fragment was then re-
leased by digestion with HindIMl, pHBIOI was digested with
HindIT and Sma Lo release the 35S promoter fragment, and
the vector was purified. The promoter-leader fragment was
then ligated into the MindI1I/Sma T-digested pHB101 to yield
pHB102 (Fig. 1). {he HBsAg coding region lies upstream of
the nopaline synthase terminator in both constructs. The
plasmids contain the left and right border regions, which
denote the limirs o the DNA that is integrated into the plant
‘genomic DNA via Agrohacterium tumefaciens-mediated
transformation, ss well as the neomycin phosphotransterase
zene, which allows selection with kanamycin

Plant Transformation. Agrobacterium strain LBAMO4
cells were transformed by the direct method (11) with the
plasmids prepared trom Escherichia coli clones, and the
