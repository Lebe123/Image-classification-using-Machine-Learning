ABSTRACT

Using SV40 minichromosomes assembled in vivo, we
have studied the relationship between a nucleosome
{ree promoter-region and initiation of transcription by
RNA polymerase Il on chromatin templates in vitro. Our
data suggest that accessibility of DNA to transcription
factors, programmed into the structure of the
chromatin, is crucial for initiation of transcription. First,
minichromosomes competent to be transcribed in vitro
contained nucleosome-free promoter regions. Second,
C219 minichromosomes, most of which contain the
nucleosome-tree promoter region, supported
transcription more efficiently both in vivo and in vitro
than wild-type minichromosomes, in which only a
subset contain the nucleosome-free region. We have
also identified basal transcription factors associated
with the in vivo-assembled chromatin templates. A
striking correlation was observed between
‘minichromosomes associated with in vivo initiated RNA
polymerases and those associated with the basal
transcription factors TFIID and TFIIE/F, and to a lesser
extent, TFIIB. Of these associated factors, only TFIID
was poised for ready assembly into preinitiation
complexes and therefore for subsequent initiation of
transcription. However, an active chromatin template
‘could also be maintained in the absence of the binding
of TFIID. Finally, our data are consistent with the
presence of TFIIF in elongating ternary complexes on
the chromatin templates.

 

 

 

INTRODUCTION

Gene expression within eukaryotic eels is regulated inthe context
of chromatin, a complex of genomic DNA. histones and noo-
histone proteins. One role of chromatin in the regulation of the
initiatn of transcription appears 10 be the control of DNA
sequence accessibility for binding of transcription factors. Various
Tines of evidence suggest that nucleosomes and transcription

 

 

  

factors may compete for binding to promoter sequences (1).
Induction of transcription in vivo from promoters covered by
precisely positioned nucleosomes (2-4) can lead to disruption
of particular nucleosomes and apparent unmasking of binding
sites for DNA-binding transcription factors (3,59. In addition,

assembly of nucleosomes in vtro inhibits transcription from both
RNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase II promoters (1015),

‘whereas formation of stable preinitiation complexes at the
promoters prior to nucleosome assembly generates tran-
scriptionally active templates (12,14~ 16).

To circumvent inhibition of ‘transcription by chromatin
assembly in vivo, transcriptionally active chromatin could form,
in several ways. Competition at promoters between the binding
Cf transcription factors and the assembly of nucleosomes could
‘occur during DNA replication, when regions of DNA near the
replication fork are transiently free of nucleosomes (17)
Alternatively. the binding of the specific DNA-binding protein
If might exclude nucleosome assembly on the surrounding
INA. thus providing promoter accessibility upon induction of
gene expression at a later time (18-20), Finally, for genes
‘eanscriptionally activated ina replication-independent manner.
inducible transcription factors able to bind to their recognition
sites in the promoters in the presence of nucleosomes might
trigger the disruption of nucleosomes, allowing the binding of
addtional transcription machinery and activation of the promoter.

Ultimately, the binding of basal transcription factors to the
promoter is essential for initiation of transcription. The roles of
the basal transcription factors have been characterized in vitro
fon naked DNA templates (21). Detinition of their roles on
chromatin templates will also be crucial for understanding,
induction of transcription from the chromatin templates in vivo.

To examine the roles of chromatin structural alterations and
‘of basal transcription factors in transcription by RNA polymerase
Hl on chromatin templates, we have studied initiation of
transcription in vitro on in vivo-assembled chromatin. An.
abundant source of in vivo-assembled chromatin is SV40.
‘minichromosomes. The SV40 genome is complexed with cellular
