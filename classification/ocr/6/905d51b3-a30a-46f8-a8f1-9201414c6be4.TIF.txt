INTRODUCTION

Ina previous study (1), the regions in which gases were
formed inside a cigarette combustion coal, the conditions
under which they were formed, and how these regions
varied during the smoking eyele, were determined. The
tgses formed in the coal distribute themselves beoween
the mainstream and sidestceam smoke, In the present
sudy, the gar semperature and concentrations ouside
the coal have been meatured, ia order co determine
‘where the permanent gases enter the sidestream plume,
nd how the sidesream formation varies during the
Smoking cyele, In addision, caleuations have been per
Formed in order to clarify certain aspects of the for~
‘mation ofthe sidetream smote plume.

 

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

“The gas temperature and concentration distributions ex
ternal to the coal have been obtained coneurcenely using
exactly the same «ype of cigarette, sampling. probe /
‘thermocouple, experimental system, and computer pro-
prams as previously described (1). The cigarette was
Smoked in'an atmosphere of 21% (v/v) oxygen /79%/e
(els) argon inside a cubie perspex chamber of 140 mma
side, The gas mixture was passed vertically chrough the
Chamber at a flow rate of 250 em? st, or a linear vel-
‘city of 12.8 mm s" past the cigarette, equivalent to a
Beaufort force 0 sir condition, Le. “calm aic” (2). In
successive experiments the sampling tip of the probe was
Positioned directly above the coal, and at angles of 45°,
50° and 180° (ie. directly below the coal) from a ver~
tical line through the axial cencre of the coal, and for
to 15 mm from the surface of the cigareste, and at

 

 

 

 

 

distances of between —10 and +10 mm from the line
‘of paper burn atthe start of the puff (Table 1). At lease
four replicate experiments were performed for each po-
sition of the probe.

RESULTS

External temperature and concentration contours at
various stages during the emoking cycle are shown in
Figures 1 xo 16. These contours are very sensitive to
movements in the external atmosphere, a5 is the visible
fidestream smoke. The exteraal contours in the present
seudy were obtained with che oxygen/argon smoking
stmosphere flowing vertically past the cigarette with a
linear velocity of 12.8 mms". This imposed velocity is
small compared to the total velocity in the sidesream
plume of 330mm s", as measured by Newrath and co-
‘workers (3). Thus the imposed flow should only have a
‘minimal effect on the plume.

Taking ‘the characreriie dimension of the smokins
chamber asthe length ofits side (140 mm), the Reynolds
‘umber for the imposed flow of 12.8 mm s* through
the chamber is 116. Thus the flow conditions pase the
cigarette out to be laminar. In confirmation of this the
sidesream smoke plume was oberserved to rise from the
coal in-a very straight column (Figure 47).

‘The 954% confidence limite (mean of four replicates) of
temperature at each point are about 25°C, and. are
bout + 10% of the mean values forthe gas concentra-
tions. These confidence limits are dve predominantly to
slight variations in-the eigareres used, and the inability
to mount the probe into identical positions in-the side~
stceam plume for cach replicate experimentrather than
‘ny variation in the thermocouple temperature/or mas
spectrometric concentration measurements. Amore de-
tailed account of the errors involved-in these types of
‘measurements has been given previouly (1).
