Recombination between artificially introduced repented
genes occurs readily in yeast in both aitotic and meiotic cells.
The levels ef, this. ectopic. recombination were found to” be

similar” to the allelic ones when different genes were assayed
Nesatic recombination between Ty clementa, on. the other” hand,
Mas found to be. lower than expected, in @ aystem using » Ty?

Stenent warked with @ ERAS gene (Kuyiec and Petes, MCB 8:2942
2a5a, Lona’.

We ‘have developed @ new system to follow recombination
batucen Ty elements. We warked a Ty] element by inserting © copy
of the SHIA (ochre) suppreser LANA. The TylSue wae inserted. at
the "LYS2 locus of a ade2-L(achre)” cant=100(echrr) ates
rendering, It Ade" Cunt. Red (Ade) “Cant colonies Can” be
Selected for on plates containing ennavanine. thene colonies
Stine in 60% of “Lhe coses as a consequence of recombination
Between the two LTRs that flank the TyiSup and in 504 by gene
Conversion between Tyl5up and uaserked Tys (only rarely the SUPE
sarker mutates or ia converted by the chromosenal copy)

An” trogenie diploid strain wae constructed and meiotic
leveln of recombination wore. scored by, random spare. analysis
As'“in the previous studies, the weiotic levels of recombination
(4.9% 2:0 k 10-5) were only one order of magnitude higher
than the mitotic Levels (0,14 + 0,07 10-4)

We intend to use this aystom ae a tool to investigate
recombination between Tyz, and to look fer wutants affected. in
this type of recombination
