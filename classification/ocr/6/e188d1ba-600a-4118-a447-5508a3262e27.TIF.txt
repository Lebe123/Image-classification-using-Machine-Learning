Rat liver microsomes catalyze a vanadate-stimulated oxidation of NAD(P)H, which
augmented by paraquat and suppressed by superoxide dismutase, but not by catalase.
NADPH oxidation was a linear function of the concentration of microsomes in the
absence of vanadate, but was a saturating function in the presence of vanadate. Micro:
Somes did not catalyze 2 vanadate-atimulated oxidation of reduced nicotinamide mono-
nucleotide (NMNH), but gained this ability when NADPH was also present. When the
Concentration of NMNH was much greater than that of NADPH 9 minimal average
Chain length could be calculated from ¥, the ratio of NMNH oxidized per NADPH added.
‘The term chain length, as used here, signifies the number of molecules of NMNH oxidized
per initiating event. Chain length could be increased by increasing [vanadate] and
[NMNH) and by decreasing pH. Chain lengths in excess of 30 could ensity be achieved.
‘The K.. for NADPH, arrived at from saturation of its ability to trigger NMNH oxidation
by microsomes in the presence of vanadate, was 1.5 um. Microsomes or the outer mi-
tochondrial membrane was able to catalyze the vanadate-atimulated oxidation of NADH
or NADPH but only the oxidation of NADPH was accelerated by paraquat, The inner
mitochondrial membrane was able to cause the vanadate-stimulated oxidation of
NAD(PoH and in this case paraquat stimulated the oxidation of both pyridine coenzymes.
‘Our results indicate that vanadate stimulation of NAD(P)H oxidation by biomembranes

Vanadate stimulates the o»
NAD(P)H by biomembranes (1-6) and this
has been attributed to a vanadate-depen-
dent NAD(P)H oxidase or to an NAD(P)H
dehydrogenase, which is converted to an
oxidase by vanadate (2, 4, 6) Since

SOD* inhibited the vanadate-stimulated
NAD(P)H oxidation (1-3, 5), we considered
the possibility that vanadate was able to
catalyze the oxidation of NAD(P)H by

we demonstrated that it could do so with
enzymatic, photochemical, or chemical
Sources of 02 (7-9). This, in turn, suggested
that vanadate might have stimulated the
oxidation of NAD(P)H by biomembranes
merely because the membranes could pro-
