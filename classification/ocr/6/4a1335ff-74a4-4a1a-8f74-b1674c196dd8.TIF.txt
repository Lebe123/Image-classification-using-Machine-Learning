‘Smoking and coronary heart disease: what

are we to believe?

Carl C. Seltzer, PhD?

‘Two recent events have raised serious questions
‘as to what we are to believe about the conven-
tional view that cigarette smoking is a cause of
coronary heart disease (CHD).

Interpretation of ex-smoker:

‘The first event relates to the interpretation of
ex-smoker data indicating that CHD mortality
rates of persons who stopped smoking are
substantially lower than those of persons who
continued smoking. The interpretation given to
these data is that smoking cessation directly
results in the reduction of risk of heart disease
mortality. The most commonly cited investiga
tions in support of this line of thinking are the
observational studies of Doll and Hill's British
doctors Hammond's American men and wom-
en,’ Kahe's U.S. veterans,’ and the Framingham
Study.’ Underlying this alleged CHD benefit,
however, is the assumption that ex-smokers are a
representative sample of smokers, except in 20 far
as they have stopped smoking. But the proof of
the validity of this assumption has not been
forthcoming. This is a crucial point in the
comparison of the CHD outcomes in the two
smoking groups. For, if the assumption of repre-
sentativeness is invalid and significant baseline
ferences are observed between ex-smokers and
samokers for relevant factors, then the possibility

exists that the mortality comparison of ex-smok-
‘ers and continuing smokers is biased.

For the first time in a very large series of
subjects according to race and sex, we observed
the proper baseline for the determination of
whether or not ex-smokers were a representative
‘sample of smokers.” This baseline involved the
study of the CHD-related characteristics of ex-
smokers before they stopped smoking and their
‘comparison with those of persistent smokers. The
results of this study are briefly reviewed below.

Using the longitudinal records from the Kaiser-
Permanente multiphasic health check-ups, the
study compared 25 CHD-related characteristics
of ex-smokers before they stopped smoking with
‘those of persistent smokers and nonsmokers. A
total of more than 25,000 subjects, white men and
women, black men and women, with three or
more consecutive health check-ups formed the
basis of the analysis. For the criteria of the
classification ofthe subject, the designated “in-
dex examination,” and the list of CHD-related
characteristic, the reader is referred to the publi-
cation? The minimum of three or more examina-
tions was used in order to insure a rigorous
classification of the smoking categories. Thus,
examokers (peristent quitters) were subjects
who had at least one examination at which they
reported both a current and past history of
Cigarette smoking, followed by at least two exam-
{nations in which they reported complete cessa-
tion of smoking. The CHD-related characteristics
fell into arbitrary categories: cardiovascular
manifestations (blood pressure, hypertension,
