Foods that fool the body with low fat

Nutritionists and food companies may have more success
promoting healthy diets If they concentrate on reducing fat in
specific foods. Unfortunately, ice cream isnt one of them.

People can judge the fat content of milk-based products
‘much more easily than the fat in mixed foods, such as chicken
salad, report Beverly J. Tepper and Susan E. Shaffer of Rutgers
University in New Brunswick, N.

‘Tepper and Shaffer tested the ability of 73 people to judge the
richness of various foods. Each person visited the research lab
twice weekly for two weeks. At each
five versions of six common foods. The
looked and tasted the same but varied in fat content and
texture. Inone est, participants judged the relative fat contents
of the different versions by comparing them to one another; in
another test conducted ona different day, they estimated théfat
content of each version separately.

In neither test could participants accurately judge the fat
content of scrambled eggs or chicken spread, Tepper says, but
in both tests they succeeded in ranking mashed potatoes and
pudding — two milk-based foods. They also distinguished the
Telative richness of crunchy snacks fried in different oils.

“In some foods, people are going to notice the difference {in
fat content}, but'in others, you can make relatively large
‘changes without people noticing,” Tepper concludes.

Alzheimer’s disease: Does the nose know?

{An insidious disease, Alzheimer’s can start to develop long.
before one can detect troublesome losses in cognitive function.
However, people with this disease also lose some of their sense
‘of smell. Researchers hope that monitoring changes in this
sense will help them detect the disease earlier and aid in
tracking its progression.

“The goal is to develop an early marker or something that
‘could {change} along with the disease,” explains Jack Pearl of
the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication
Disorders in Bethesda, Md. “An olfactory test is a relatively
noninvasive way of testing”

‘Toward that end, several research groups have begun
studying the ability of older people, with and without Alzheim-
e's, to detect and remember odors,

Ina study conducted at the University of California, San
Diego, Medical Center, 65 people with Alzheimer’s disease and
‘82 healthy people of similar ages and backgrounds underwent
vision, taste, and odor tests. The vision and taste components.
helped the scientists determine whether the participants were
‘of sound enough mind for testing and whether deterioration
had occurred in more than one sensé

‘One of the odor tests required participants to sniff alcohol
from pairs of plastic squeeze bottles and pick out the one with
the stronger scent. By supplying bottles with different concen-
trations of alcohol, the researchers could tell at what concen-
tration the person first detected the odor. The same people also
sipped sugar water samples with differing degrees of sweet-
ness and were asked to spit out the sweeter one.

Participants with Alzheimer’s needed much stronger odors
than the healthy sniffers, say Claire Murphy and Steven Nordin,
who led the study. “The more demented [the person], the
higher the threshold, but there was no such correlation for
taste," adds Nordin. “The research suggests there isa specific
detection dysfunction to odors.”

Furthermore, he notes, in the seven people with Alzheimer’s
disease who have now been tested for three years, the average
yearly change in the odor-detection threshold has correlated
with the progression of dementi

A second experiment assessed the participants’ ability to
recognize odors they had smelled earlier. Each person looked

at 10 faces of presidents and 10 engineering symbols and
‘smelled 10 common household odors. They then examined a
second set of faces, symbols, and odors, half of which came
from the first set. Participants tended to score the same when
rating familiar faces and symbols as when rating odors they
had sniffed earlier. But Alzheimer's patients scored lower
‘overall, indicating a general decline in memory, says Nordin.

At Duke University in Durham, NC., psychologist Susan S.
‘Schiffman and her colleagues track changes in healthy people
‘who are at risk of developing Alzheimer’s. So far, the study
involves 22 such individuals and 22 people matched for age,
‘gender, race, level of education, and handedness who are not,
‘considered at risk or the disease, Participants undergo several
tests, including ones in which they pick the stronger of two
flavors or odors and are asked to remember familiar ones.

‘The twogroups differ only intheirability toremember odors,
reports Brevick G. Graham of Duke.

“I wouldnt suggest that [odor testing] would ever replace any
‘of the cognitive measures, but it might be used in addition to
‘other things for early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s.” he says.

There's no accounting for taste

Countless studies have indicated that animals avoid bitter
foods. But some actually prefer acrid flavors, reports John 1.
Glendinning of the University of Arizona in Tucson.

While Glendinning was at Florida State University in Tal-
lahassee, he studied the eating habits of two species of wild
Mexican mice. He discovered that while none of the Peromyscus
‘melanotismice liked bitter flavors, seven of 64 Peromyscus azteca
mice preferred quinine water over regular water. He then offered
both species hop extract, tannic acid, and two other bitter
‘substances. “These chemicals are realy different, bt neverthe-
less they all elicit similar responses,” Glendinning told Science.
News, “individuals that prefer quinine were more likely to prefer
‘other bitter chemicals” up to a certain concentration.

Glendinning calls this the “Schweppes effec,” after the tonic
water that some people prefer over regular water. Citing other
studies showing that some goats, opossums, and squirrel
monkeys like bitter foods, he suggests that many animals
‘exhibit this effect, although he doesn't really know why. He
suspects, however, that in foods — particularly plants —
bitterness may reflect higher nutritional content.

How sweet a protein can be

‘A reddish fruit sold in Nigerian markets has provided
scientists with yet another supersweet protein. Ounce per
‘ounce, this S2-amino-acld protein, called brazzein, provides
2000 times the sweetness of sugar, reports Ding Ming, @
biochemist atthe University of Wisconsin-Madison. He and
Wisconsin colleague Gran Hellekant isolated the protein from
Pantadiplandra brazzeana, a vine plant that produces a fruit,
slightly bigger than a grape.

“The sugar [content] isnot that high; we guess thatthe sweet
protein plays the same role as sugar,” says Ming. Sweetness may_
encourage animals to eat such fruits and help disperse seeds,
he explains.

Brazzeins lysine-rich amino acid sequence beats tittle
resemblance to those of other sweet proteins (SN: 5/19/90,
315), which tend to contain many more amino acids, says
Ming. This protein also proves quite stable, surviving 98°C
temperatures for at least two hours. and’ maintaining. its
sweetness in a wide range of acidic and alkaline solutions, the
researchers report. Moreover, electrical recordings from taste
‘nerves of primates reveal thatthe protein elicits a purely sweet
sensation, with no aftertaste. The Wisconsin scientists have
applied for a patent for the protein,
