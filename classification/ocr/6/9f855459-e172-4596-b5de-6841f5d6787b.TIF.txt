Recent reports have suggested that the majority of
the molecular traffic through the Golgi apparatus is
comprised of recycling, rather than newly synthesized,
‘molecules. To evaluate the importance of this recycling.
pathway in greater detail, we examined the internali-
zation and reveling of cell surface glycoproteins on
EL-4 cells, a murine T-cell lymphoma, using sialic
acids as covalent markers. Sialic acids were removed
from the surface of living cells by exhaustive treatment
with Vibrio cholerae sialidase at 4 °C and shown to be
derived primarily from glycoproteins (93%), with only.
‘4 small amount from glycolipids (7%). Cells were r
cultured at 37 °C over time and monitored for the
resialylation of the cell surface using a sensitive high
pressure liquid chromatography adaptation of the thio-
barbituric acid assay for sialic acids. The return of
sialic acid to the cell surface was found to be contingent
‘upon de novo protein synthesis indicating that the bulk
of plasma membrane sialogiycoconjugates do not re-
eycle to an endogenous sialyltransferase-containing
compartment for oligosaccharide reprocessing. Iden~
tical results were found for K562 cells, a human eryth
roleukemia cell lin

‘The movement of specific glycoproteins was followed
using the enzyme rat liver a2~GGald1-4GIeNAc sialyl-
transferase together with CMP-[*H)NewAc as an im-
bermeant probe of the cell surface, Surface sialogly-
coproteins were internalized slowly, a process unal-
fected by eyeloheximide treatment. Only a few of tese
internalized glycoproteins were found to return to a
trans-Golgi compartment followed by reeyeling to the
cell surface. Taken together, these data indicate that
the majority of replacement of sialic acids on the cell
surface is due to de novo synthesis of glycoproteins and
that only a small number of glycoproteins recycle
through a trans-Golgi compartment.

the outward movement of uewly synthesized proteins along
the biosynthetic pathway; and 2) the inward movement of
molecules collected from the extracellular environment as
well as plasma membrane molecules, A number of studies
hhave implicated the ¢rars-Colgi network as a common com.
Partment through which newly synthesized as well as inter-
‘alized proteins pass (reviewed in Farquhar, 1985; Fishman
‘and Fine, 1987; Griffith ca, 1986; Herzog, 1961; Romagnoli
and Herzog, 1987; van Douts vt al, 1988; Yamashiro etl.
1984).

‘The internalization ot plasma membrane glycoproteins and
their subsequent return zo the cell sueface has beon observed
in many laboratories (reviewed in Brown eta, 1989; Fishman
‘and Cook, 1986). At present, both the mechanisms which
induce the internalization of cell surface glycoproteins and
the intracellular pathways they may take are unclear. For
example, the igand-induced endocytosis of cell surface recep.
tors has been shown to include the return of some of these
78 to the cell suciace atter deposition of ligand in an
intracellular compar ment (reviewed in Goldstein et a,
1985). However, binding ut specific ligand may not be the sole
signal for internalization, Endocytosis of receptors for trans-
ferrin, low density lipoprotein, «,-macroglobaiin, T-lympho.
exte antigens (T3/Ter), and asialoglycoproteins has been
demonstrated to occur in the absence of corresponding ligand.
(Ajioka and Kaplan, 1985: Anderson et al, 1982; Kaplan and
Keogh, 1981; Krangel, 1951; Schwartz et al, 1984; Watts,
1985). The specific itinerary followed by an internalized recep.
tors another complexity. asa given reeeptor may follow more
than one intracellular puciway (Fishman and Cook, 1986;
Stein and Sussman, 1956). The transport of internalized
molecules to the Goigi cisternae has been demonstrated for
transferrin receptor, and total cellular glycoproteins, resulting
in biochemical reprocessing of their associated oligosacchas
ides (Regoecei et a 1954: Snider and Rogers, 1985, 1986),
‘The question then arises as so whither all cell surface glyco.
proteins are similarly intemalized or whether internalization
‘and oligosaccharide reprocessing includes only a selected pop-
ulation,

We designed experiments to elaborate on three aspects of
cell surface glycoprotein movement. First, to what extent is a
Golgi-mediated reprocessiny pathway utilized hy the cell to
maintain steady-state levels of cell surface sialylation? Sec.
‘ond, to what degree is internalization selective? Third, can a
functional correlation be drawn between those glycoproteins
Which are reeyeled and those which remain resident on the
cell surface?

Sialic acids are added in the Golgi cisternae at a late stage
of glycoprotein processing (Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985). In
our studies, sialic acids were used as a covalent marker by
which the movement of cell surtace glyeoproteing could be
traced, We used two novel techniques to assess the silylation
state of the cell surface anc of individual glycoproteins on the
plasma membrane: 1) to:il cell surface sialie acid was quan.
