Human high-density Lipoprotein class-3 (HDL) was
incubated with freshly isolated blood polymorphonu-
clear leukocytes (PMN) at 37 and 4 °C. At both tem-
peratures the release of proteolytic activity (PA) caus-
ing the specific hydrolysis of apo-A-II was dependent
on the concentration of HDL; in the medium, At 37°C,
the efflux of PA was linear and no saturation was
reached up to an HDL, protein concentration in the
‘medium of 800 ug/ml. In turn, at 4°C, maximal PA
release was reached at a concentration below 600 ug/
ml of HDL, protein/ml in the medium. Canine HDL,
‘which contains apo-A-I, but not apo-A-IT, was as effe
tive as human HDL, in promoting the release of PA
from PMN. This property was also exhibited by egg
lecithin/eholesterol vesicles containing apo-A-I. At
4°C, there was no strict correlation between efflux of
PA affected by HDL; and specific binding of "*I-apo-
A-I(HDL,). In competitive binding experiments, a 50.
fold excess of unlabeled HDL, prevented more than
90% of the binding of "*I-apo-A-I (HDLs) to PMN,
‘whereas an excess of unlabeled low-density lipoprotein
exhibited no effect. When human HDL, was incubated
‘with PMN at 4 or 37 °C and then subjected to ultracen-
trifugation at d 1.21 g/ml, most of the PA that was,
initially associated with this lipoprotein was recovered
in the bottom of the tube. By gel filtration, both PA
and HDL; were in the same peak ina low ionic strength
buffer, but were dissociated from each other by a high-
salt solution (4 1.21 g/ml). We conclude that both ns
urally occurring HDLs and apo-A-I-stabilized lipid
vesicles favor the release from PMN of an enzymatic
activity which cleaves human apo-A-II. This release
appears to be dependent both on the interaction of the
cells with the lipoprotein ligand and on the lipoprotein
surface area acting as the acceptor for the enzyme,
probably through electrostatic forces.

with human plasma HDL,” apo-A-II is enzymatically cleaved
‘to small molecular weight components which are retained in
the lipoprotein particle (1). [n contrast, litle or no changes,
were observed in apo-A-I, the major protein constituent of
HDL. Subsequently, we found that of the blood leukocytes
only PMN cause the proceolysis of apo-A-II in HDLs (2).
‘Since litle is known of the function of apo-A-I, the demon-
stration that PMN contain a protease capable of a specific
cleavage of apo-A-II prompted us to examine in vitro the
mechanisms underlying the release of this cellular protease
and the role played by HDL in this process. The results of
‘these studies are the subject of this report. A preliminary
‘account has appeared (3).

A, Studies with Human HDL

1, Dependence of Protease Release from PMN on the
Presence of HDL in the Medium

PMN (40  10* cals) were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with
human HDL, in concentrations ranging from 0 to 800 ug of
protein/ml. After incubation, the cells were sedimented by
‘centrifugation at 150 x g for 10 min. The supernatants were
centrifuged again at 400 X g for 10 min, brought to d 1.21 g/
ral and ultracentrifuged st 108,000 x g for 36 h. Most of the
PA was recovered in the bottom 0.9-ml fraction (total volume
= 63 ml) of the tubes (Fig. 4). The proteolytically active
fractions were dialyzed against 0.15 mt NaCl, pH 7.0, 0.02%
azide, incubated with 1-spo-A-II (HDLg) for 10 min at 37 °C
and proteolysis was assayed by trichloroacetic acid precipita
tion and 10% polyacrylamide (0.2% SDS) gel electrophoresis.
‘The selection of a 10-min incubation time came from prelim-
inary experiments (not shown) indicating that the proteolysis
