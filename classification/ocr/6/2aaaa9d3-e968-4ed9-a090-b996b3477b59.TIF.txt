Summary

‘The growth-suppressive function ofthe retinoblastoma
Gene product, RB, has been ascribed to the under
phosphorylated RB form that prevails during G1 phase
{mn the cell cycle. Wo show that adaltion of the para-
rine growth Inhibitor transforming growth factor bt
(TGF-51) toMviLu lung epithelia colls in mid to late Gt
Prevents phosphorylation of RB scheduled for this cell
‘eycle stage and arrests cells In late Gt. Expression of
'8V40 T antigen, a transforming protein that binds un-
derphosphorylated AB, does not block the effect of
‘TOF.p1 on RB phosphorylation but greatly reduces the
‘growth-Inhlbitery response to TGF-31, TGF-O1 and RB
‘appear to function in a common growth-inhibitory
pathway In which TGEA1 acts to retain AB In the un-
<derphosphoryleted, growth-suppressive state,

 

  

  

Introduction

Call proliferation can be restrained by limitations in the
‘supply of mitogenic stimu, but also by the action of naga
tive growth regulators. Evidence for paracrine growin
hibitors ang intracellular growth suppressors is accumu:
lating. Proposed or confirmed examples ofthis class of
‘molecules include secretary palypemtide growin inhibitors
lik transtorming growth factor 6 (TGF-8) and nuclear phos-
‘phoprotans like tne retinoblastoma gene product. A ques
tion that arises as different types of growth suppressors

19 identi is whetner they could be part of com-
‘mon growth.innibitory pathways.

TGF. is a paracrine polypeptide found ubiquitously in
vertebrates, and protoiypic ofa large family of metazoan
Growth, citferontiation, and morphogenesis factors (lor
Feviews see Massagué, 1987, 1990; Roberts ang Spor,
1980). Wnin nis family, ta TOFS group incluces atleast
three highly homologous genes (TGF-I, TGF-82, TOF63)
present In humans and cther mammals, with additional
‘Genes prosontin avian and ampnibian genomes (Osrynck

al, 1885: Hanks ot al, 1968; ton Oj ot al, 1988;
Lakoinlew ot al., 1988). Al TGES forms tested diay
{rowth.nhibtory activity in normal or transformed epith

I, endothelial, fibroblast, neuronal, lymphoid, and he
‘matopoitic cell types (Tucker etal, 1984; Moses eal.
1985; Roverts ot al, 1885; Kehr! ot al., 1986; Fre

Schroder ot al, 1288, Ohta ot al, 1987; Kimehi at a.
1988). Tho extont of the growth.inhibitory response to
TOFS varies by call type, with lung epitnelial calls and
keratinooy!es showing the strongest response, @ virtual
‘growth arrest (Tucker ot al, 1984; Shipley etl. 1986). Un-
{er certain conditions, txoblast cal lines and osteoblasts
‘can be mitogenicaiy stimulated by TGF, and in some f-
Droblasts this response appears to be secondary to pro:
ucton o! autocrine mitegans (Shipley et al., 1985: Leot
etal. 1986; Centrela tal, 1987) In adaition to hese ef-
fects on col! proltration, TGF can positively or nega-
tively affect the citferentiaton process or the expression
of differentiated functions in colls of soveral lineages
(Massague. 1930; Roberts and Sporn, 1990). Physiclog
Cally, TGF 's implicated in morphogenesis, issue repair
processes, anc fibrotic disorders. Some o! these actions
‘may result in part trom tne abilty of TGF.) to regulate the
expression of maitipie extracelisiar matrix proteins (ignotz
fand Massagué, 1936; Roberts et a, 1985: Laiho at al.
1986) and cai! acresion receptors (Ignetz and Massagud,
1987; Heino et a. °969).

The mechanism of growth inhibition by TOFD is vr-
wally unknown. inhibited expression of growth-related
genes (mc, XC. JE) by TGFB appears to play an impor.
lant rte n certain endothelial. carcinoma, and keratino-
‘70 els (Takonara tal, 1987; Farnander-Pol etal, 187,
Coffey et a, 1988) but notin fibcoblasts (Chambard and
Pouyssegur, 1988; Sorrentino and Bandyopachysy, 1989)
‘The etfects of TGF on jun proto-oncogene expression do
‘ot se0m to correlate with elfects on eal proliferation (Per-
tovaara etal, 1989). TGS does net appaar n general,
to inhioit ca growth by inactivating receptors fr growth:
Promoting tactrs (Like and Massagué, 1986; Chambard
‘and Pouyssegur, 1686), although this mechanism might
‘operate in some cal types (Bryckaert otal, 1988; Gron-
Wald et a., 1989). TGF binds with high aftiny to thes
Call surface procoins (Cheifetz eta, 1987; Massagus et
a, 1990}. Gonatic evidence has linked TOFD receptor
'ypes | ang il to mediation of the growthinnbitory re-
sponse to TGF. (Boyd and Massagué, 1989; M, L. and
‘JM, unpudl'sned data). The third TGF-B Bining compo-
ent, & membrane proteoglycan named betaglycan, has
‘9 known lo in signal transduction (Cheitetz and Mas-
‘agué, 1988; Anares ota, 1989).

The reincblastoma gone (RBI) encodes @ procuct with
Presumptive growth-suppressive activity This activity has
been preciciea on 19 basis of tha phenolype of human
familial retinoblastoma, a malignancy in which loss of
function by m.tation or deletion of the two allees of the.
tetinoblasioma gone is associated with oss of cel growth
control (Knudson, 127%; Cavenee etal, 1983; Oryja ot a.
1986; Friend st al, 1986; Fung et al, 1987; Leo ot al.
19672). Detects in A131 In ether types of tumors, such as
‘sarcomas and small cell lung carcinomas, indicate
wider role for this gone in oncogenesis (Hansen et
1985; Friend wt ai, 1986; Harbour etal, 1988; TAng et
al, 1988; Horowitz et al, 1989; Bookstein
