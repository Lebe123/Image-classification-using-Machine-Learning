ABSTRACT The antibiotic azatyrosine (DL-3-(5-hydroxy-
2-pyridyDalanine] suppressed meiotic maturation in oocytes
Induced by progesterone or the combination of [Val!™]p21t==
‘microinjection and insulin-like growth factor I. The suppres-
sion was dose-dependent in the range of 20-250 1M azaty-
rosine. In addition, azatyrosine blocked the tyrosine phosphor
ylation of Xp42, a member of the mitogen-activated protein
‘kinase family, after progesterone or [Val!?}p21!="™/
insulin-ike growth factor I stimulation. Activation of matura-
tion-promoting factor, as shown by a decrease in the tyrosine
phosphorylation of the Xenopus homolog of p24°2, was also
Suppressed by azatyrosine. Azatyrasine had no effect in vivo or
in vitro on the growth factor-induced autophosphorylation of
the oocyte insulin-like growth factor T receptor. Azatyrosine
hhas been shown by others [Shindo-Okada, N., Makabe, 0.
Nagahara, H & Nishimura, S. (1989) Mol. Carcinog. 2,
159-167] to inhibit the growth of ras-transformed cells without
affecting that of nontransformed cells. In oocytes, the antibiotic
‘exerts an inhibitory action on both a ras-dependent and 9
vras-Independent pathway. Lack of an effect of azatyrosine on
‘germinal vesicle breakdown induced by the microinjection of
‘an extract from mature oocytes, however, suggests that aza-
tyrosine is acting upstream of maturation-promoting factor
activation,

 

 

 

‘The high incidence of mutated ras genes in human eancer (1,
2) has led many investigators to direct theit research efforts
toward ras as a potential target for cancer therapies. One
approach has been to block the biosynthesis of the oncogene
product by expression of antisense mRNA (3). This method
‘was utilized in a human lung cancer cell line to block the
production of the K-ras protein and has also met with some
‘success in an in vivo tumor model. Another approach takes
advantage of the ability of mutated ras proteins to cause
transformation when expressed in cultured cells, By using
this technique, large numbers of compounds can be screened
‘on the basis of differential effects on the growth of the
transformed vs. the parental cel line. This method was used
by Shindo-Okada ef a. (4) to identify & potential antitumor
‘compound, azatyrosine. Azatyrosine, an antibiotic isolated
from Streptomyces chibanensis, inhibited the growth of NIL
313 cells transformed by Ha-ras but had little effect on the
growth of nontransformed cells, Moreover, azatyrosine
‘caused the phenotypic reversion of transformed cells that
persisted even after the antibjotic was removed from the
cculture medium.

Beceuse the effect of azatyrosine appeared to be quite
specific for the ras-transformed cells, we chose to investigate

its action in a totally different ras-dependent system.
Prophase-arrested oocytes of the African clawed frog Xeno-
‘pus laevis can be induced to mature in vitro by progesterone,
insulin, or insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). The pathway
involving insulin or IGF-I requires endogenous ras protein (5)
‘and can be activated in the absence of exogenous hormone or
growth factor by the microinjection of oncogenic forms of ras
(6). In contrast, the progesterone pathway is independent of
the ras gene product. Use of the oocyte system, therefore,
permits the investigation ofthe effects of azatyrosine on two
Separate pathways, both culminating in a common end,
meiotic maturation.

In this paper, we show that azatyrosine suppressed mat-
uration in oocytes induced by the combination of ras micro-
injection and IGF-I. The antibiotic also inhibited progester-
‘onesinduced maturation. Progesterone or ras/IGF-1 treat-
meat of oocytes induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Xp42,
‘8 member of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase
family (7), prior to germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). This
tyrosine phosphorylation of Xp42. was blocked by azaty-
rosine. The antibiotic had no detectable effect, however, on
the autophosphorylation of the oocyte IGF-I receptor.

 

   

   

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Materials. Adult female Xenopus laevis were obtained
from Xenopus 1 (Ann Arbor, MI), Receptor-quality IGF-1
‘was purchased from Mallinckrodt. Azatyrosine (D-345-
hydroxy-2-pyridyi)alanine] was generously provided by A.
Hudson (Wellcome Research Laboratories, Beckenham,
U.K,). Recombinant (Val!p21% was purified from Esche-
richia coli as described (8). {P]ATP was from DuPont/
NEN. L-(4,5°H)Leucine and 112,3,5,6Hityrosine were
from Amersham. All other chemicals were purchased from
standard suppliers.

‘The anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-p34°? antibodies were
both mouse monoclonal antibodies purchesed from Upstate
Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The antip34*? antibody
was made using residues 30-57 (VAMKKIRLESEEEGVP-
STAIREISLLKE) of the predicted amino acid sequence of
human ede2 as imunogen (9). The anti-Xpd2 is a rabbit
polyclonal antibody (no. 1913.2) and was kindly provided by
