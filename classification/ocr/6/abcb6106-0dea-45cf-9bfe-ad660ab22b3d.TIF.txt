Infection in Granulocytopenic Mice

‘Abstract

BALB/c mice immunized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa im
‘munotype 1 polysaccharide develop protective T cell famanity
‘to bacterial challenge. Invitro, T cells from immunlzed mice kill
P. aeraginosa by production of a bactericidal lymphokine. The
‘present stody demonsiries that adoptive transfer of T cell from
Immmenized BALB/< mice to granulocytopente mice resulted ln
‘97% survival on challage with P. aeruginasa, compared with
27% survival with adoptive transfer of T cells from oonimmune

 

{© granaocytopenic mice. These studies indicate tht taster
‘of specific mmane T lyaphocyts can significantly enhance tbe

Introduction

‘Analysis of immune resstance to infection with gram-negative

leukopenic patients using granulocyte transfusions and sero-
‘therapy have had only limited success (4 3)

The role of T lymphocytes in resistance t0 infection with
‘amm-negative bacteria has been thought to be limited to tepu
lation of the antibody response. We have previously demon.
fsrated that T lymphocytes from BALB/c mice given the eyo.

isolated from P. aeruginosaimrounotype I (TI) ean adoptively
‘ansfer resistance toinfecton tononimmune mice (6) We ase
stablshed that splenic T calls ebtained from imenunized mice
‘could kill P. aeruginosa io vitro (7). Afer in vitro reeaposure

yemphokine that kills abroad raage of gram-negative and pram=
positive bacteria (7) Ths kiling requires the presence of neither
‘nvbody nor complement, and it oocurs im the absence of
phagocytic ells (7)

‘The murine T cell that mediates the bactericidal efec is of
{he Lyt 1". 2° phenotype and reacts with monoclonal antibodies
ircted at the putative MF antgen (8). Macrophages are required
in this system only as a source of iterleukin 1 (L-1) (8) and
fonction neither as antigen presenting cells nor as phagocytic
cxlls In addition, we have iSentied strain of mouse, CB.70,
congenic with BALB/c mice tthe Igh-1 locus, that fais 10 iil
P aeruginosa inthis ia vitro mode (9). The nonresponsivencss
of this strin is attributable 10 the activity of suppress

‘The current studies were designed to investigate further the
'm ‘avo significance of this T lymphocyte-medisted immune
‘sponse. Using a murine mode! of granulocytopenta, we found
‘that adoptive transfer of immune T cells could protest mice
from a lethal challenge with P aeruginase, even inthe absence
‘of granulocytes; but protection could not be achieved with non.
immune T cells. nor with immune B cell, T cells from the
€B.20 mice. which did not kill Paerainasa in our in vitro

with the in vitro bactericidal activity ofimmune T cell. P aera.
