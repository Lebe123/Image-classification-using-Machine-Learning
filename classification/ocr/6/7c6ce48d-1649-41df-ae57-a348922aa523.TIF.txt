wT ROUCTION

While there has becn an increased interest in investagating
9 possible correlation(s) between DRA methylation and oncogenic
transformation, conflicting published reports have indicated an
increase (1-5), a decrease (6-8) oF no change (9-10) in the
extent of methylation associated with oncogenic transformation.
In particular, we found 1attle or no change in total gonomic
DNA methylation levels associated with oncogenic transformatian S
by eimian virus 40 in hunan fibroblast cells when measured by
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (11). We then
Wished to ask what the effect of chemical transformation was on .
total genomic DNA methylation as measured by HPLC. To answer this
intriguing question, we have neacured the levels of DNA methylation
An mouse 373 cells transformed by benzo(a)pyrene (12) and methy2-
cholanthyene (13) and in normal moune 37? cells. The resuits of
these anvestigations ere presented in this report.
