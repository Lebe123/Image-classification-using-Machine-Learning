Run-around PCR: A novel way to create
duplications using polymerase chain
reaction

‘We have used a modified form of re
‘verse PCR entitled “run-around PCR”
‘and have used it to create a specific
‘zene duplication. This technique could
‘be quite valuable for preparing dimers
‘or multimers of specific nucleic acid
sequences for affinity purification

 

 

procedures or for use as probes in ex:

pression library sereening (4); to create
‘gene-specific duplications in knock-out
‘constructs; 10 create exon duplications
in pre-mRNA splicing constructs; of
for any of a variety of imaginative
purposes. We have not determined the
‘upper-size Limit that still allows com-
plete extension around the parental
plasmid, but note that technological
improvements, such as those used in
ong PCR (1,2), may make this upper
limit very large.
