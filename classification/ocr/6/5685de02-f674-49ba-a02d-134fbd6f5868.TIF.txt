seemed possible that this amount might
influence the response of mouse skin to the
carcinogenic effect of smoke condensate,
quite apart from any effect of the dilution
of carcinogenic constituents. The experi.

determine whether the presence of glycerol,
as a diluent of tobaceo condensate, itself
influenced the carcinogeificity of the con-
