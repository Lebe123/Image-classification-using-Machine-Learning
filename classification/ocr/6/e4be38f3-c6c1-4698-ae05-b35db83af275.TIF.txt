Abstract

‘Stimulation of PMN with inflammatory mediators markedly
‘augments Fe and CRI receptor-mediated ingestion. However,
‘CDI1/CD18-deficeat PMN from three patients with complete
leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) failed to recruit phago-
‘ytic function in response to phorbol estes, cytokine, or Arg-
Gly-Asp-containing ligand stimulation. Because stimulated i
gestion i protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent, our data indicate
that LAD PMN exbibit only PKC-independent phagocytosis.
‘The defect in PRC-dependent ingestion is specific for CD11b/
‘CDIB and not secondary (the chronic or recurrent infections
which occur in this disease. The LAD phenotype for phagocytic
function can be reproduced in normal PMN by the anti-CD11b
MAbs OKMI and OKMIO. In contrast, MAb Mol (anti~
COLD) and MAD 1B4 (anti-CD18) inhibie both CDITb/
(CD18 dependent and -indepeodent rechanisms of ingestion by
normal PMN. Theie ability to inhibit CD11b/CD18-indepen-
deat ingestion may be mediated by cAMP, as shown by experi
‘meats with a protein kinase A inhibitor HA1004 and by direct
‘measurement of AMP levels in immune complex-and FMLP-
‘stimulated PMN. These data indicate that CD11b/CD18 inde-
pendent and dependent mechanisms of phagocytosis exist and
that some effects of anti-CD116/CD18 MAbs may be me-
diated by alterations in cAMP levels. (J. Clin, Invest. 1991.

Introduction

Phagocytassis a complex biological process of specialize cells
which is essential for normal host defense. It is necessary not
‘only for the uptake and destruction of pathogens but also for
the clearance of immune complexes, removal of damaged tis-
sue, and initiation of wound repair. Despite its central role in
hhost defense, knowledge of the regulation of phagocytic func-
tion at inflammatory sites has lagged behind understanding of
activation of the respiratory burst and exocytosis, other func-

tions of profesional phagocytes required for the maintenance
‘of homeostasis. Recent investigations from our group into the
regulation of human neutrophil (PMN) phagocytosis have led
us to hypothesize that phagocytosis by PMN is primarily a
recruited function at inflammatory sites (1-5). Stimulation of
PMN with various inflammatory mediators markedly aug-
‘ments both Fe- and CRI-mediated ingestion (1-8) This re-
cruitment of phagocytic function i reflected not only in the
total numberof ingested targets but also in the percentage of
PMN participating in the phagocytic process (1,2). Presum-
ably, this regulation of ingestion acts to limit the damsging
products of PMN activation, such as toxic oxygen metabolites
and sereted lysosomal products, tothe ste of inflammation.
‘We and others have found that PMN can recruit several
<istnet molecular mechanisms for phagocytosisin response to
inflammatory signals, which may be regulated further by the
specific opsonin (IgG, Cab, C3, and C3) and opsonin recep-
tor(FeRIl, FeRIIT, CR, and CR3) engaged (1-9). In addition,
‘monocytes and macrophages employ quite different molecular
rechanisms for phagocytosis from those employed by PMN,
‘even when the same opsonin or opsonin receptor is involved
(1, 10), In this manner, at inflammatory sites where PMN and
macrophages encounter pro-inflammatory cytokines, interfr-
‘ons, interleukins, chemotactic peptides, and components of
ion isnot only augmented, but
‘the molecular mechanism involved in phagocytosis may be
alteced. Asan example, we have shown recently that ingestion
of IgG -opsonized targets by nonstimulated PMN is not depe
dent upon protein kinase C(PKC)' activation. However, when
PMN are simulated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF-2),
not only is ingestion ofthe IgG-opsonized targets markedly
increased, but PKC translocation is also greatly augmented
over the minimal amount observed with either IgG or TNF-«
alone (11). This synergism inactivation of PKC is essential for
the increased ingestion by PMN exposed to TNF-a (11). The
Jmportance ofthese dat tohost defense is demonstrated by the
fact that PMN from patients with chronic granulomatous dis-
case (CGD), which lack the ability to generate a respiratory
‘bust, s well as PMN from patients with paroxysmal nocturnal
hemoglobinuria, which lack expression of FeRIL, fail to am-
plify ingestion of gG-opsonized targesin respons to cytokine
(CENF-x) stimulation (4,12). Therefore, defects the diferent
