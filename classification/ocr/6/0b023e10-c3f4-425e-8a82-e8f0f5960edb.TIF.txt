ABSTRACT. Objection. Az past of a long-term study
‘of possible effects of early life otitis media on speech,

Results. We followed 2253 infante until age 2 years,

variables that cach remained indepenéentiy and spate
cantly related to the cumulative propostion of days with
MEE were: ducing the frst year of lite, clad site group

index rating the degres of exposuze to other children at

sex, the socioeconomle index and the child exposure

reports, the provatence of otltie media during the fiest 2

fants appears to be as higit ax {f not higher than among
