‘The Rad2, Rad3, Rad4, and SsI2 proteins are required for nucleotide excision repair in yeast cells and are
homologs of four hurman proteins which are involved in a group of hereditary repair-defecive diseases. We
have previously shown that Rad3 protein is one of the five subunits of purified RNA polymerase II basal
{anscription initiation factor b (TEHLH) and that Ss12 protein physically associates with factor by (W. J. Feaver,

RD. Kornberg, Gel 75:1375-1387, 1993). Here we show that the Rad? and Rad proteins inceract with purified
factor bin vitro. Rad2 (a single-stranded DNA endonuclease) specifically interacts with the TIL subunit of
factor b, and we have mapped a limited region of the Rad2 polypeptide which is sufcient for this interaction.
Rad? also interacts directly with SsI2 protein (a putative DNA helicase). The binding of Rad2 and Radé
proteins to factor b may define intermediates in the assembly of the nucleotide excision repair repairosome.
Furthermore, the loading of factor b (or such intermediates) onto promoters daring transeription initiation
provides a mechanism for the preferential targeting of repair proteins to actively transcribing genes.

 

 

  

      

 

The processes of DNA transcription and DNA repair appear
tobe conserved between yeast and human species, and several
lines ofevigence indicate that these processes ar aso closely
interrelated (7, 32), In mammalian cells, the initiation of
transcription from RNA polymerase II promoters requires the
general transcription factors TFIIB, TFIID, TFUIE, TFIE,
‘TEU, and TFUL, together with RNA polymerase I, to form
8 printiation complex (9). ‘The transition to an elongation
complex appears to involve phosphorylation of the carboxy:
terminal domain of RNA polymerase Ml and a candidate
kinase activity has been identified in purified fractions of
‘TRUITT (31). series of equivalent general transcription factors
hhave been purified from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 10
particular, the yeast counterpart of TFIIH, factor b, also has
Associated protein kinase and a DNA-dependent ATPase
activity (11,12)

Purified factor b consists of five subunits of 85, 95, 55,50,
and 38 kDa (12, 49). The 75-kDa subunits the product of the
TEBI gene (17), and it has recently been shown thar the 85
and S(-KDa subunits are encoded by the RAD3 and SSLI
ones, respectively (13). Rad3 protein is a DNA/DNA and
DNA/RNA helicase and is one of atleast seven yeast proteins
(Rad! Rad2, Rad3, Rad’, Rad1O, Radi, and S312) which ure
required for nucleotide excision repair (NER) (16,22, 34,48).
Ss protein is @ putative DNA helicase (19). Though not a

component of puifed factor b, Ss protein has been shown to
associate with purified factor b through a specifi interaction
with Rud3 protein (4, 13). Similarly, it has been demonstrated
(45) that XPB (ERCC3) protein, the human homolog of Ss,
‘coputifies with ‘TFIH, (The nomenclature for naming cloned

designation C at the end of the gene or protein name is
‘dropped. For example, the gene previously designated XP4C
[for XP group A correcting is now called XPA. Genes thal a
proven disease alleles are no longer referred to by ERCC
Aesignations. For example, the XPD gene is no longer called
ERCC2. However, the ERCC designation should be retained
‘until the gene in question is proven to be an XP for other
disease] allele.) Both Rad3 and SsI2 proteins are exceptional
among the known yeast NER proteins ia that they are essential
for cel viability, even inthe absence of DNA damage (19, 6,
38). Studies with conditional lethal rad} (20) and ssl2

‘mutants have demonstrated the absolute requis
wild-type alleles in basal transcription.

Collectively, these observations have led to the suggestion
that Rad3 and SsI2 (and Ssi1 and 01) may function solely as
transcription proteins which control the expression of DNA
repair proteins but play no direct role in NER (see reference
15 for a review). Alternatively, Rad3 and SsI? may participate
directly in both NER and basal transcription, in which case
their functions in these two processes could be independent
and unrelated or closely coupled. The latter possiblity could
help explain the observation that transcriptionally active re
gions are repaired more rapidly than the overall genome (7,
22).
