Mortality in relation to smoking: 40 years’ observations on male

British doctors

Richard Doll, Richard Peto, Keith Wheatley, Richard Gray, Isabelle Sutherland

‘After the rwo large case-control studies of 1950 that
showed ling cancer to be closely related to smoking,”
prospective studies were needed that could determine
‘Which other diseases were also related ro the habit. In

 

‘was of the result after 20 years. We now report the
remults of following them for 40 years wo 1991 and
‘compare the apparent effecs of cigarette smoking on
‘mortality fom all causes during the first and during the
second halves of the sudy. We report also the
‘morality during the entire 40 year period from 48
specific causes of death, or groups of causes, in men
‘with diffrent smoking habia, and the effec of
mopping smoking at different ages, and we discuss the
extent to which the effecs of emoking on certain causes.
‘of death are positively or negatively confounded by the
‘effect of alcohol.

‘The hazards of tobacco have been documented by
many other smadies, which have been mummarised by
the Royal College of Physicians,” the United Stares
‘Surgeon General" and the Intemational Agency for
Research on Cancer.” Some prospective studies have
‘been far larger than ours ours, however, bas been
continued for more than twice a8 long a8 any other,

 

(1951-71) of this srady, therefore, the hang cancer rates
fn middle aged men’ were higher in Britian than
smywhere ele in the world, and during the second half
C(STI-9D, the lung cancer rates in men in old age in
Britain were among the highest. Hence, a smady of
smoking and death among British men during there
years may be particularly informative about the
hnazards of ong continued cigarette use.

‘At the end of October 1951, questionnaires were
‘sear to all the men and women whose names were on
the Beith medical reginer and who resided in the
‘United Kingdom. Simple questions were asked about
their smoking habics, and replies sufficiently complete
‘tm be used were received from 6194 women and 34439
men. When las reported,* one woman had been
misakenly classified es male, until diagnosed xs dying
of uterine cancer. The relatively few female smokers
‘had not in general, smoked as long or as intensively 2s
the male smokers, 40 ther they do not provide direct
{information about the effects of long rerm smoking."
‘The present report is therefore restricted to the 40 yee
follow up of the men. Inquiries sbout changes ix
smoking habite and some further details about them
were made of the men in 1957, 1966, 1972, 1978, and
1090; on the last two occasions, inguicies were alzo
made about alcohol consumption and some ot: :r
pervonal characteristics. Demiled accounts of tae
‘questions asked and of the response rates to the earlier
‘quetionnaires have been given previously.”>*" Replics
