INTRODUCTION
Recently the possible deleterious effects of atmospheric pollutants on man have
received wide publicity. A aumber of reports on the effects of cigarette smoke
induced by smokers ina confined space or by smoking machines in chambers have
shown an increased incidence of subjective symptoms such as headaches and
ievtation ofthe eyes and respiratory passages (Johansson and Ronge. 1965: Edito-
Fal. 1974: Rylander, 1974: Schmidt. 1974, Weber et wl., 1976). However. rela-
tively little is known of systemic effects of various concentrations of ambient
cigarette smoke on maa or animals. Previous studies have shown that exposure to
‘environmental stresses caused chnges in blood chemistry and changes in body
temperature that aided in the diagnosis of the severity of stresses (Selye, 1950:
Highman and Aland, 1962, 1966; Hess. 1963: Garbus ef w.. 1968). No such
studies have been reported on the acute effects of increasing concentrations of
tobacco smoke. Consequently we have determined the effects of different
amounts of cigarette smoke on changes in plasma lactic dehydrogenase and
creatine kinase of rats which were maintained for 4 hours at rest or after light
exercise. We have also determined the effects of smoke upon body weight and
temperature, blood lactic and pyruvic acids. blood glucose, plasma corticos-
terone, and tissue changes.
