prior reports have indicated that snslysis of nicotine at plco-
am por milter levels was unreliable. Significant and
‘arlable nicotine adsorption on the diferent materials used
‘uring analysis was recognized as a source of error, and
suppression of nicotine adsorption phenomena during sample
preparation by addition of NH,OH was found to be a crfical
{actor In obtaining rellable resuits at this concentration. We
have adapted ths method, using # trogen sensitive detector
‘and gas chromatographic techniques, to determine nicotine
reproducibly In at, water, and blood plasma, The lowest
detectable amount Is 2-5 pg of nicotine Injected into the
‘column, and the calibration curve is linear up to 2000 ng/mL.
‘The relative standard error of estimate of peak area depen-
dence on concentration is 8%,

 

  

In the past 2 decades several gas chromatographic tech-
sigues forthe determination of nicotine have been described
U-9). The determination of nicotine in biological fluids
(plasma urine, milk) has been of particular interest to in-
estigators studying the biologic effects of tobacco smoking.
In almost all cases, prior to the introduction of gas chroma-
‘ographic (GC) techniques, nicotine had to be extracted from
ological fluids by relatively complex procedure which were
‘less than fully quantitative. Futhermore, the final extract
‘represented a complex mixture of organic compounds that
‘ave many peaks in the gas chromatogram which were difficult
{o interpret

‘This complexity was reduced substantially bythe intro
duction of a nitrogen-sensitive detector into the GC procedure.
As the nitrogen-sensitive detector does not respond to organic
compounds containing only C, H, and O atoms, it yields a
relatively simple GC spectrum. Compared to flame ionization
‘detectors (FID), the higher sensitivity of the nitrogen-sensitive
‘detector has made it easier to analyze solutions where nicotine
‘apresent in minute concentrations (for example, in te blood
‘of human smokers). On the other hand, the increased sen-
sitivity introduced by these techniques makes it more difficult
‘to achieve an acceptable level of reproducibility of the ex-
‘taction and determination procedures, partiularly for sam-
les that contain a low concentration of nicotine. For this
teason, many investigators adopted the use of internal
‘Standards and evaluated their samples relative to this internal
standard, expressing their resulta as “nicotine ratios". To
‘improve analytical results, Feyerabend (4) suggested the use
‘of quinoline as an internal standard, but Hengen and Hengen
(7) were unable to obtain good results using his method.

In our experience, even simple nicotine solutions in water
organic solvents at concentration level of tens of nanograms
Der milliliter were difficult to analyze reliably by gas chro-
‘atography using Feyerabend's method. Disturbing phe-
‘Romena, such as ghost peaks of nicotine, were observed. In

tion, unexpected losses of nicotine occurfed. Similar
difficulties seem to have been encountered by olher authors.
For example, Dow and Hall (6) presented a calibration curve
for nicotine in terms ofa “nicotine internal standard response
ratio" that showed a distinct value ofthis ratio even for 270
concentrations of nicotine. They therefore developed a com-
bined technique employing gas chromatography-mass spec-
trometry (GC-MS) (9) forthe determination of nicotine.

‘The objective of our present study was to investigate the
sourees of interferences observed in previously described gas
chromatographic methods and to develop a gas chromoto-
graphic method for reliably measuring concentrations of
Dicotine less than 1 ng/mL in gases and liquids.

EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

Preparation of Standard Solutions of Nicotine. Known
scutions of nicotine were prepare from liquid nicotine (purchased
{rom Sigma Chemical Co, St. Louis, MO). According to the
manufacturer’ specifications, the purchased product contained
5% water. Isopropyl ether Fisher Scientific Co.) was purified
before use by repeated sheking with an equal volume of con-
centrated ammonium hydroxide until the hydroxide layer showed
to coloration. Heptane and ammonium hydroside were “Beker
“Analyzed” reagents. Standard solutions of niotine were prepared
by dissolving 5 ul of liquid nicotine in § ml. of (a) water, (b)
heptane, (¢) isopropyl ether, and (d) a 0:50 mixture of heptane
tnd isopropyl ether using @ 10uL, Hemilton ayringe. Heptane
tnd isopropyl ether were aay Kept above a water layer saturated
‘with ammonium hydroxide. ‘The solutions, containing 1 mg of
Bicotine/mL., were diluted 100x to obtain a concentration of 10
g/ml. and diluted « further 100x to obtain a solution of 100
‘g/mL. Calbration curves were prepared for various concen
teations of nicotine, When 100 ng/ml. concentrations in different
solvents were analyzed by gas chromatography, the areas of
nicotine peaka produced by a 7-nL injection agreed within 10%,
‘The following important conclusions can be drawn fom a tSpical
nicotine calibration curve constructed from standard solutions
of nicotine in isopropyl ether and heptane: (a) the calibration
curve using peak height or peak area is linear over 8 concentation
ange upto 2000 ng/L with standard errr of eatimate of peak
‘rea dependence on concentation of 8% and (b) it intersecta the
1 point of coordinates indicating that no loses or guns (ghost
‘peaks) were present. Standard solutions stored at room tem-
Perature gave constant readings (less than 19% standard error of
the mean from 23 meamurements) over periods of many weeks
‘when a drop of § N'NH,OH was added on a weekly basis to
Ginplace nicotine adsorbed on the walls of the glass container.
Chromatographic Analyses, Ges chromatographic analyses
were performed on a Hewlett Packard gas chromatograph, Model
5730'A, equipped with a nitrogen-senstive detector. Nitrogen
wwas used asa cartier gas. Flow rates of nitrogen (35 ml/min),
© hydrogen (8 mL/min), and air (50 mL/min) were adjusted ac-
C2 carding to manufacture’ specifications forthe detector. Nicotine
> determinations were performed with a6 ft long glass column fled
with 80-100 mesh Chromosorb W coated with 10% Apiezon L
Containing 3% of KOH. Column temperature was 190 °C, in-
‘ection port temperature was 250°C, detector temperature was
