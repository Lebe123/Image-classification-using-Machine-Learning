‘The results of last year’s studies (1)
dicated that cortain changes in the Cundi
‘Marianas and in the so-called “tentative”
methods were needed. ‘Subsequently, the
Cundiff-Markunas method (2) was modified
(3) to inerease the recovery of nornicotine
from tobacco and to eliminate the necessity
for potentiometric titration when high nor-
nicotine tobaccos were encountered. These
modifications, made by the authors of the
original paper, were: (a) the uso of sodium
hydroxide in placo of barium hydroxide to
liberate tho alkaloids, and (b) the addition
of gincial acotic acid to the acotylated sample
before titration with pereblorie acid. Also,
the 1958 studies showed that Griffith's
methoul was a little more efficient in recover-
ing alkaloids than the tentative method;
ently, & new procedure was written

istillation conditions of Grif-
fith (4) bat permitting the use of any of the
conventional apparatus, including Griffith's.

 

 

 

 
  

‘Tho two modified methods and five tobacco .

samples wore sent to collaborators with the

 

request that samplés be analyzed in «upliento
and that all data be reported on forma sip
plied. In addition to having a choico of stills
in the distillation method, the collaborators
were allowed to choose between the gravi-
metric and spectrophotometrie methods for
‘measuring the alkaloids distilled. Four of the
five samples, the flue cured, Turkish, Mary-
land, and cigar filler, were the same tobaccos
used in 1958, but tho burioy tobnero was
replaced by a new sample with a higher alka
loid level. The samplex, which had been
ground to pass a 1 mm sieve and had been
mixed well, wero oquilibrnted in air and
sealed in screw-capped give jars. The sam-
ples were to be analyzed “as roccived” and
the data reported on the same basis.
