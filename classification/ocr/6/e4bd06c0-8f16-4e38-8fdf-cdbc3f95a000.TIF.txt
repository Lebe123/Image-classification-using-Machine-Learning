INTRODUCTION

 

During the last decade. con:

rable attention has been devoted to the question of

whether environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) causes disease in nonsmokers (USSG.
1986; NRC. 1986: EPA. 1990a). Some epidemiologic studies of nonsmokers presum-
ably exposed to ETS have suggested a marginal increase of risk for some diseases
previously associated with active mainstream smoking (MSS). These reported risks.
however, border on statistical and epidemiologic insignificance. and could easily derive

from numerous and documented biases and confounders.

‘Official reviews have stopped short of implying a causal role of ETS in most of these
associations, with a notable exception for lung cancer. This exception has been based
not so much on admittedly questionable epidemiology. but on a public health stance
of concern driven by perceived—but largely undocumented—compositional similar-
