Accessibility of tobacco products to youth aged 12-17 years - United States,
1989 and 1993

Although the sale of tobacco products to minors is illegal in all
states and the District of Columbia (1), the prevalence of cigarette
smoking among adolescents has continued to increase (2), and most
minors are able to purchase tobacco products (3). Reducing sales to
minors is believed to be an effective measure for reducing the
prevalence of tobacco use (4). To determine recent patterns of minors’
access to tobacco products from retail outlets and vending machines,
data were analyzed from the 1989 and 1993 Teenage Attitudes and
Practices surveys (TAPS I and TAPS II). This report summarizes the
results of that analysis, which indicate that most minors who use
tobacco purchase their‘own tobacco and that small stores are the
sources of most purchases.

Samples for both TAPS I and II were drawn from households that
participated in the National Health interview Survey (NHTS), a
continuing nationwide household survey that collects information from a
representative sample of the U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized
population aged (greater than or equal to] 18 years. Both TAPS I and IT
collected information on adolescents’ knowledge, attitudes, and
practices regarding tobacco use. TAPS I data were collected by
telephone interviews; TAPS II data were collected by telephone and
personal interviews and included both a new probability sample and a
follow-up of respondents from TAPS 1. Data for persons aged 12-17 years
in each survey were analyzed (n=7773 for TAPS I; n=6165 for TAPS Ii)
and weighted to provide national estimates. SUDAAN was used to
calculate standard errors for determining 95% confidence intervals
(cIs) and to perform multivariate logistic regression analyses of TAPS
II data; simultaneous adjustments were made for age, sex,
race/ethnicity, and region of the country. Differences between TAPS I
and TAPS II for selected estimates were assessed by using the
Generalized Estimating Equations software (5S). Adjustments were made

for subject correlation and age.

Adolescents in both TAPS I and II who were current smokers were asked
about purchase practices, and all respondents were asked about
perceived ease of purchase (6). In TAPS II, adolescents who usually
bought, ever bought, or ever tried to buy their own cigarettes were
