‘C838-C346, 1996.—We evaluated a role for protein kinase C
(PKC) in the regulation of rabbit tracheal epithelial Na-Cl(K)
cotransport, Short-term treatment with phorbol 12-myristate
S-avetate (PMA) dose dependently increased bumetanide-
sensitive Na and Cl efflux and elevated staurosporine- and
>bumetanide-sensitive Na, Cl, and K uptake. PMA and the
ayvadrenergic agonist guanabenz both induced cotransport
with a stoichiometry of 2 Cl:1 Na and 2 Cl:1 Rb and elevated
staurosporine-sensitive PKC activity in cytosolic and particu-
late fractions. Prolonged PMA treatment did not sustain
bumetanide-sensitive 2 Cl:1 Na and 2 Cl:1 Rb transport but
did block stimulation of bumotanide-sensitive transport by
PMAor guanabent and elevation of PKC activity by PMA and
guanabenz in a particulate fraction. Cells treated with oka-
daic acid exhibited a staurosporine- and bumetanide-sensi-
tive 2 Cl:1 Na and 2 CL: Rb uptake. In cultured monolayers,
basolateral perfusion with epinephrine, isoproterenol, or
PMAincroasod ehort-cirouit eurrent ([y)-Basolateral applica-
tion of bumetanide reduced elevated J. to baseline levels,
indicating a role for Cl secretory cells in a reconstituted
tracheal epithelium, Pretreatment of transmonolayer cul
‘tures with PMA diminished the stimulatory response to
epinephrine. These results indicate that, in rabbit tracheal
epithelial cells, a-adrenergic stimulation activated Na-2C1-K

at PKG is a critical effector in this process.

‘ONE MODE OF TRANSPORTING the electrolytes Na and Cl
‘that is common to many cell types is cotransport of the
electrolytes Na and Cl, which is directly coupled to the
inwardly directed Na electrochemical gradient as the
driving force for Cl uptake. An additional requirement
for K is seen in some cells under specific stimulatory
conditions, such as, for example, vasopressin stimula
tion of mouse medullary thick ascending limb (82). We
have previously shown that Na-Cl cotransport in hu-
man and rabbit tracheal epithelial cells is activated by
a-adrenergic agonists (15) and hyperosmotic challenge
(16). The Ca ionophore ionomycin mimics the response
too-adrenergie stimulation. Other studies show second-
ary activation of cotransport in canine tracheal epithe-
lial cells, which is mediated by agents that stimulate
cal Cl channels to induce Cl secretion (10, 11). These
studies correlated stimulation of salt secretion by isopro-
terenol, ATP, and UTP to the equilibrium level of
saturable, basolateral bumetanide-binding sites. The

finding of increased bumetanide binding with induction
of Cl secretion was interpreted as upregulation of
cotransport in Cl secretory cells.

Our finding of direct activation of cotransport by a
adenosine 3',5'-eyclic monophosphate (cAMP)-indepen-
dent mechanism led to detailed studies of the intracel-
lular signaling of the a-adrenergic stimulation. The studies
first focused on effectors involved in Ca-dependent mecha-
nisms for signal transduction. The results demonstrate
a-adrenergic activation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-
bisphosphate (Ptdins(4,5)Pz}-specific phospholipase C
with subsequent hydrolysis of Ptdine(4,5)P, to two
intracellular second messengers, inositol phosphate
(17) and diacylglycerol (18). The transient nature of
mediator release within a time frame that coincides
with cotransporter activation suggested a link between
Ca and diacylglycerol. These two intracellular media-
tors are activators for some isotypes of protein kinase C
(PKC; Ref. 31).

PKC subsumes a family of at least 10 subtypes, some
of which require Ca for activation (26, 31), PKC has
been linked to the regulation of other electrolyte trans-
porters, including cation and anion exchangers that
operate during cell volume regulation, salt absorption,
and pH regulation and ion channels that are required
for secretion, in particular an apical Cl channel (2, 4,6).
‘A useful tool in identifying and characterizing PKC
regulation is phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA),
phorbol ester that activates PKC (31). The effects
PMA often show a time dependence that is interpreted
as resulting from activation (early) or downregulation
Cate) of PKC. For example, with some ion exchangers,
such as Na/H or CVHCO, (of thyroid and Vero cells,
respectively), short-term treatment with PMA acti-
vates ion exchange, whereas long-term treatment with
PMA, which chronically activates PKC, fails to alter
electrolyte transport through ion exchangers (22, 34).
In the latter instance, chronic activation of PKC leads
‘to downregulation due to increased sensitivity to prote-
lysis (81). Short-term PMA treatment can induce
opposing responses, as seen in intestinal and renal
epithelial cells (35). In these cells, Ne/H exchangers
found on apical membranes are inhibited by PMA,
which produces an opposite effect of stimulation on
cation exchangers in the basolateral surface.

PMA also influences the activity of Na-Cl-K eotrans-
porters in epithelial and nonepithelial cells. Fibro-
blasts (27, 30), endothelial cells (26), and osteoblasts
(88) express a cotransporter that is sensitive to PMA,
‘thus suggesting regulation through PKC. Phorbol ester-
stimulated cotransporters of cell lines derived from
epithelia, such as colonic HT-29 (1) and T84 cells (12),
