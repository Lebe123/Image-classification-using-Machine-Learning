‘The ability of carba-prostacyclin (¢PGI,), a stable analog of
prostacyelin (PGI), 0 inhibit 12-O-etradecanoylphorbol-
Saacetate (TPA}-induced transformation of JB cells was
investigated. JB6 cells sensitive (P*) and resistant (P-) to
‘TPA-induced” transformation to anchorage-independent
srowth were plated in soft agar in the presence or absence
‘of ePGl; for 14~21 days. Transformation frequencies were
determined by recording colony numbers. ¢PGI, was found
{inhibit TRA induced transformation of P* cells in a dose-
dependent fashion with 1M ePGl; producing ~S0%
imbibition of colonies in soft agar. Our findings are consistent
‘withthe hypothesis that TPA-induced transformation in JBS
cell variants is mediated by PGI; via regulation of adenstate
eyelase activity and cAMP accumolation, with resultant
inhibition of expression of the transformed phenotype,
reflected in anchorageindependent growth.

 

Introduction

Recently we reported that murine epidermal 186 cell lines
sensitive (P*) and resistant (P~) to tumor-promoter induced
transformation to anchorage independence uifferentally respond

calcium ionophore A23187 oF the combination of 12-0-
-aleearoylphiorbol-I3-acetate (TPA) and A23187- with
‘enlanced release of prostacyclin (PGI) (1). This difference was
‘oF particular interest in that, although both cel variants release
prostacyclin upon stimulation, P~ cells release ~ 3-old more
‘eketo-prostaglandin F), (6-keto-PGF,,), a stable metabolite of|
PGI,, as compared to” cells (1). A'number of eicosanoids
were measured in these stules but no quantitative differences
were observed between the two cell lines,

In cemin cell types, PGl; is a potent agonist of adenylate
cyclase producing an increase in CAMP (2), which has been
proposed 10 inhibit tumor development (3.8). Forskolin. 3
Simvlator of adenylate cyclase, inhibits TPA induction of
‘tansformation in JB6 P* cells in'a dose-dependent fashion (3)
Furthermore, treatment with A23187 has been shown to produce
«moderate reduction inthe TPA induced transformation of P=
‘lls (6), a treatment that we have shown synergistically enhances
feleane Of PGty in these cells (1). These data suggested that
Gis, possibly through stimulation of adenylate cyclase, may
play an intbitory ole in JB cell ansformation, Therefore. we
