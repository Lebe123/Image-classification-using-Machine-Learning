Directional perturbation factors for jer and shimmer were calculate from the sustained
production ofthe vowels, /al, and fu by 20 adult male and 20 adult female speakers
Directional factors for iter were less than directional factors for shimmer. Shimmer direc
tional Factors for females had greater values than forthe male speakers. Speculations on
the relationship of directional factors and magnitude factors are made with reference to the
laryngeal relenogenic system. The usefulness of directional factors to early diagnosis of,
laryngeal disease are discussed.

 

INTRODUCTION

Within recent years, speech science has focused on changes in patients”
speech that accompany laryngeal pathology. For instance, measures of
cycle-to-cycle variations in fundamental frequency (jitter) and variations.
in cycle-to-cycle amplitude (shimmer) have been useful in describing the
voice characteristics of both normal and pathological speakers (Koike,
1973; Hollien, Michel, and Doherty, 1973; Koike, 1969; Murry and Doh-
erty, 1977; Smith, Weinberg, Feth, and Horii, 1978; Horii, 1979, 1980)
This irregularity in vibration has been implicated as a physical correlate
‘of rough or hoarse voices (Moore and Thompson, 1965; Michel, 1966:
Coleman and Wendahl, 1967). In addition, jitter and shimmer measures
have been applied to the early detection of laryngeal pathology (Lieber-
man, 1963; Crystal, Montgomery, Jackson, and Johnson, 1970). The
acoustic analysis used in these studies presumes that voice characteris
tics, examined in terms of the laryngeal vibratory rate, are peculiarly
powerful and sensitive parameters for measuring the functional and an-
atomic status of the laryngeal mechanism,

Hecker and Kreul (1971) identified an effective parameter for separating
