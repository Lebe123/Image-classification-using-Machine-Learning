ABSTRACT. Recently two lines of evidence have implicated
that cellular heat shock proteins (hap) ray pay «role in steroid
hormonal regulation of target tissues, One i the demonstration
that cellular 90K tp (hsp-90) can complex with steroid recep
tors in vitro and inhibit their ability to interact with DNA, and
second, the demonstration that in wan oviduct ex steroids can
‘regulate the synthesis ofhsp-108. Aa yet, tere lao eport that

H™ shock proteins are a group of related proteins,

which are induced in response to stress in a wide
range of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells (1, 2). The
classical inducers of these proteins in eukaryotic cells
are elevation in temperature (heat), heavy metals, alco-
hol, and glucose starvation. The precise function of these
proteins is not known, but overall they are thought to be
intimately involved in maintaining tissue homeostasis,
Recently, one of the stress proteins, the 90K heat shock
protein (hsp-90) has received considerable attention with
regard to its possible role in regulating steroid hormone
action in target tissues. A cellular hsp-90 has been shown
to be associated with a variety of molybdate-stabilized
nonactivated steroid-receptor complexes (3, 4), and this
association has been found to be responsible for main-
taining the receptor in a state unable to interact with
DNA in vitro (65, 6). It has also been speculated that hsp-
‘90 may satisfy the criteria for the in vivo cellular protein,
responsible for masking the DNA-binding site of the
receptor in the absence of steroid (5-8), In addition to
the documentation that hsp-90 can complex with steroid
receptors in vitro there are two reports which reveal that
steroid hormones can regulate the synthesis of hsp. In

the chicken oviduct hsp-108 has been shown to be under
transcriptional regulation by estrogen and progesterone
(9). Similarly, in L929 cells dexamethasone has been
shown to augment the synthesis of hsp-90 (10). ‘These
observations suggest the possibility that in target tissues
for steroids, steroid hormones and cellular hsp-90 may
‘mutually regulate their cellular functions.

For the last 2 decades the rodent uterus has been used
Widely as a model system for delineating the mechanisin
of estrogen action and estrogen receptors in mammalian
cells. Therefore, it seemed plausible to us that an exam.
ination of the potential relationship between estrogen
action and cellular hsp-90 in mouse uterine tissue may
Provide us with certain insights concerning the possible
cellular function of hsp-90. Accordingly, we have exam-
ined the steroid hormonal regulation of hsp-90 in mouse
uterus and report that estradiol increases the level of this
protein in a steroid- and tissue-specific manner.
