INTRODUCTION

[Nicotine replacement therapy offers anew approach
toaid smoking cessation. The objective of developing,
‘new transdermal nicotine system (TNS) was to pro-
Vide a dosage form wit the capability of maintaining
‘constant low levels of nicotine in blood over an extend
ed period after dosing. Controlling drug delivery by the
‘wansdermal route may provide an effective means of
minimizing nicotine withdrawal symptoms witha great
patient acceptability,

‘The objective of the pharmacokinetic studies with
different TNS was to characterize the pharmacokinetics,
and the bioavailability of nicotine from different TNS
after single and repeated administrations to humans.
‘The pharmacokinetic investigations were a part of phat:

 

rmacological studies assessing the local and systemic
tolerability and the pharmacodynamics (6).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

‘All.the study protocols had been approved by the
Ethics Committee. After verbal and writen informa-
‘ign on the tet preparation and the aim and procedure
(of the study, the subjects signed a declaration of con-
sent which gave them the right to withdraw from the
study at any time without indicating a reason. The
volunteers had a complete medical check-up no longer
than 12 months prior tothe study and were found to
be apt to participate in human pharmacological studies.
For reasons of tolerability, the subjects were nicotine-
dependent smokers. Two weeks prior to the start of
