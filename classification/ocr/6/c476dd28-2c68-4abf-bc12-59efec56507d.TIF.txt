Proteins and nucleic acids carry out specific functions, such
‘as molecular recognition, information transfer, and catalysis, which
‘depend in detail onthe structure ofeach macromolecule. Cleavage
of DNA or RNA by metal chelates san important rew approach
to characterizing structural features of nucleic acids and their
ccampexes in solution." because chain scission by reactive oxygen
species oocurs close to where the redox-active metal complex is
‘bound. Likewise cleavage of a protein by a reagent bound at a
particular site could give information about the folding of the
polypeptide chain?

Fora protein cleavage method, several criteria must be met
Reagents capable of cleaving peptide bonds and suitable for at-
tachment at specific sites must be devised. If peptides are wo be
identified by standard sequencing procedures, conditions must be
found under which cleavage of the polypeptide backbone pre-
dominates over degradation of amino acid side chains, producing
fragments with free amino and carboxyl termini. Cleavage re-
actions should occur at oF near physiological conditions of pl,
temperature, and ione strength. Generally, it wil be preferred
thatthe chain not be cleaved atthe amino acid residue carrying
the cleaving reagent but rather at sites that are nearby in the
thee-dimensionel structure (though posibly distant inthe primary
sequence.

 

  

achieved this by introducing a metal-binding site at
cone poston in a polypepie chain. We attached an iron chelate
{o8 unique residue on the protein bovine serum albumin (BSA),
treated the proten-chelate conjugate with HO, ascorbate, and
observed the production of three peptide fragments which together
account for the entire polypeptide chain.

‘The experimental procedure is outlined in Figure 1. Site
specific conjugation of BSA was achieved by allylation ofthe only
free sulfhydryl (cysteine-34)* with 1-(p-bromoacetamido-
‘benzyl)-EDTAS The los of -SH was monitored with Ellman's
re it,° and it matched the gain in chelating groups, measured
by "CoH titration.” This indicates that the reaction was restricted
to the ee estine residue ofthe protein. The chelating groups
‘were specifically loaded with Fe**, and cleavage was accomplished
bya es treatment with ascorbste and Hy, at pH 7.0, 25 °C

‘The products were analyzed by electrophoresis? In Figure
2 (lanes 5-9), thee major cleavage products may be observed,
at postions corespoding to molecular weights = 4SK, 17K, and
'SK._ Control experiments demonsrated the specificity ofthe
observed chain scsion and its dependence on protein tertiary
Suructure. Without the chelate, but with re Fe™ inthe reaction
‘mediam, only faint band at M, < 45K was produced (lane 3)
No significant cleavage was observed when the protein was un:
