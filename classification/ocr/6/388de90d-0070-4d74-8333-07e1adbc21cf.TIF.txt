Fischer rat fibroblasts, naturally resistant to killing by the fibrotropic strain of minute virus of mice

Lpacvovirus MVM(p)], became sensitive to MVM when transformed by polyomay

 

rus. This sensitization did

 

‘nat involve an inerease in the pereentage of cells which synthesized viral capsid antigens or in the percentage
Of cells which produced infectious virus. The addition of anti-MVM antiserum to the growth medium of
‘MVMGinfected cells had only a small effect on theic survival rates, indicating that the majority of the killing
ifec of MVM occurs in a single cycle of infection, The data indicate that cell killing by MVM is independent
‘of infectious virus production and thus support the notion that the preferential cytolytic effect is affected by
‘ral eylotoxic gene products which accumulate to intolerable levels in transformed cells but not in normal ones.

iy, using cells transformed with polyom:

'as and genomic and subgenomic clones of polyomavirus, we

showed that the extent of sensitization to killing by MVM depended on the transforming agent used.

Certain parvoviruses possess the intriguing capability to
destroy oncogenically transformed cells selectively in cule
ture while having litle or no effect on the viability of the
parental, untransformed cells. This preferential toxicity to
Transformed cells may account forthe inhibition of intuced
tumorigenesis (oncosuppression), reported to occur in Vivo
2.6, 8, 11, 22, 25-27).

"a variety of ells have been used to study the preferential
killing effect of autonomous parvoviruses. These include
tmouse 313 eels (13-15), several at lroblast cel ines (13),
and human Rbroblasis and epithelial cells (3,4). A variety of
transforming agents have also been used, including simian
virus 40 (1, 4 10, 14, 13), avian erythroblestosis vins (3),
human ras'oncogene (18), and radiation and chemical ca
inogens (1,4). These studies show that (the killing efect.
of transformed cells is dependent neither on the type of cell.
for on the transforming agent used and (i) the preferential
Killing of transformed cells is correlated with clevated
expression of the viral genome. In this study, we invest-
faled the question of whether the production of infectious
Virus was required forthe selective iling effect of minute
Virus of mice (MVM),

“The Fischer rat embryo fibroblast cell line (F-11) chosen
for this study is subject to astringent contact inhibition, its
anchorage-independent grovih i extremely low, and it has @
very typieal broblastc appearance. These properties allow
relatively easy isolation of cells with transformed pheno-
types (2), The F-lLL and F-L1UVPy (polyomavirus-trans.
formed F-1L1) cell lines used in this study were obtained
from T. Benjamin, Additional polyomavirus-ransformed
cell lines, established in our laboratory by using the method
of Fluck and Benjamin (7), were also examined and yielded
essentially identical results. ll the transformed cell lines

strain of MVM [MVM(p)]. MYM(p) iofection caused a
transient and slight cytopathic effect at days 1 and 2, after
which the culture recovered and a normal growth rate was
resumed. In contrast, the polyomavirusetransformed deriv-
ative cell lines were destroyed completely by MVM(p)
infection within 24 h (Fig. 1). The total yield of infectious
virus produced in polyomavirus-transformed cells was 10°
to 10%-fold higher than that produced in similarly infected
‘untransformed cell lines (Table 1). This difference range in
virus yield is comparable with those of other permissive!
restrictive systems for MVM (9, 20, 21, 24). A subline of
mouse L-cells, A9 [which is used as a standard permissive
cell line for MVM(p)], was also included in all our experi
ments for comparison. Table 1 shows that virus production
in A9 cells was only slightly lower than in F-111/Py cells.
To investigate the relationship between the killing effect
and virus production, cell killing during a single cycle of
infection was quantitated by using an infectious center
lassay. This assay was performed as follows. At 4 h post
fection the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered
saline to remove unattached and unabsorbed virus,
trypsinized, suspended in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium
containing 35 mM HEPES (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'=
2ethanesulfonic acid) buller (pH 7.3) supplemented with
10% fetal calf serum, and counted. Serial dilutions were
prepared in the above medium, poured onto 60-mm dishes
Containing monolayers of § X 10° A9 indicator cell, and
incubated for 4 10 8 h {0 allow all cells to attach. The
monolayers were overlaid with agar, incubated for 5 to 6
days at 37°C, and then stained with 0.2% neutral red in
Hanks salts solution containing 0 mM HEPES buffer, pH
7.3, and 0.45% Bacto-Agar (Difco Laboratories). Plaques
were counted 20 later. These assays consistently showed
that the MVM(p) permissive fraction in F-111 cells was
nearly identical to that found in the polyomavirus transfor
mmants (Table 1), alhough the lethal effect of MVM(p) was
fitch more pronounced on the latter. Furthermore, irmm
nofluorescence staining revealed similar percentages of cells
