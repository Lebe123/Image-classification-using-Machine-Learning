lent and Ce"-independont. PKC isozymes «, & Be. and
+ are Ca. and phosphoipddependent kinases (12-

independent phosphoipd simulsted kinases (15~18).
Tsozyme specrfc properies such as substrate speciic-
thes (12, 17, 19-21), subcelular locations (22-26), ac-
tWation requirements (12-14, 19-2.27. 26), and rates
of down-modulaton (28-31) sugges! that diferent iso
zymes may perform uniquo celular functions. However,
