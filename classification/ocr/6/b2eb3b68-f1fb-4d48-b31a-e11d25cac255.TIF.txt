‘any epidemiological studies have
disclosed an association  be-

  

morbidity and mortality from arte-
Flosclerotie heart disease (ASHD).
This relationship appears less con-
cing than that relating CS to res-
piratory diseases and causal role
of CS to ASHD has not been con-
sipcingly demonstrated. Results of
pharmacologie investigation
cerning the effec of CS or nicotine,
the latter regarded as the cardio-
‘vascular effector of CS,*** on the car-
diovascular eystem have been con

Acting and indeed in some instances
contradictory to the view relating CS
{o ASHD. In a previous study per
formed in ovr laboratory it was ob
served that the daily administration
af nieotine for three months filed to
aquanttatively or qualitatively affect
‘theroteleroris of the aorta, extra
rural and intramoral branches of the
erie, visceral lesions, oF
serum lipids in normotensive or hy
pertensive rabbits with and without a
etary supplement of cholesterol
The dose of nicotine wilized was
equivalent to that amount absorbed
by man smoking approximately 35
cigarettes per day.

“The purpose of the present study
seas to investigate the pathologie ef
{eels of “cigarette smoking” on the
cardiocatcolar and other tissues in
‘abbits as revealed by coronary angi
‘ography and appropriate histologic
{ecnniques. Such studies, a8 well a8

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those of serum lipids, were performed
in untreated rabbits and those sub-
Jected to hypercholesterolemia or in-
duced atherosclerosis
