Abstract

Torombospondin (TSP), a multifunctional a-granule glycopro-

tein of human platelets binds fibrinogen, fibronectin, heparin,
histidine-rich glycoprotein (HIRGP), and plasminogen (Pig),
and thus, may play an important role in regulating thrombotic
Influences a vessel surfaces. In this study we have demonstrated
that purified human platclt TSP formed atrimolecular complex
with human Pig and HRGP. Complex formation was detected
by a specific binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) which demonstrated simultaneous binding of fuid-
phase Plg and HRGP to TSP adsorbed to microttration wells.
While neither ligand inhibited complex formation of the other
with TSP, 10 mM eamino-r-caproie acid selectively blocked
incorporation of Pig into the complex, suggesting that TSP
contains independent binding sites for Plg and HIRGP. Com
parable extent of trimolecular complex formation was also
detected when TSP monomer was substituted for whole TSP
inthe ELISA. HIRGP covalently crosslinked to Sepharose 4B
simultaneously bound both "S-TSP and "1-Pig, confieming
teimolecular complex formation, Rocket immunoelectrophoresis
‘of mixtures of the purified radiolabeled proteins into anti-Pig
containing agarose also confirmed trimolecular complex for-
tation, The TSP-HRGP-Pig complex hound 2 similar amount
of heparin as the TSP-HRGP complex, demonstrating that the
HIRGP within the trimolecular complex maintained functional
capability. Similarly, using a Muorometsie plasmin substrate,
the trimoleclar complex was shown tobe an effective substrate
for tissue plasminogen activator. Significant amounts of plasmin
were generated from the TSP-HRGP-Pig complex (cquivalent
to that from the TSP-Plg complex), but the rate of plasmin
aeneration from the trimolecular complex was greater than
from the bimolecular complex, suegesting an important inter-
action of HRGP with Plg when both are complexed to TSP.
‘The macromolecular assembly of these three proteins on
celular surfaces, such a5 the platelet, may serve important
regulatory functions, both prothrombotic at sites of active
fibrin deposition and proteolytic ln noafibriaontaning miero-
‘environments.

(G, 4) and becomes surface associated upon platelet stimulation
G). It is also a product of endothelial cells (6, 7), fibroblasts
(@), and monocytes (9), and isa constituent ofthe extracellular
‘matrix (8). TSP is @ multifunctional molecule that appears to
be organized, like fibronectin (10), into diserete functional
domains (11-13), The endogenous lectin of human platelets
is TSP (14, 15) and anti-TSP Fab partially inhibits platelet
aggregation (16), suggesting an important role in platelet
function. Among other known functions of TSP are the ability
to bind specifically with heparin (1, 11), fibrinogen (17),
fibronectin (17, 18), and type V collagen (19), and thus,
perhaps play a role in extracellular matrix organization, cell-
cell and cali:matsix communication, and modulation of he-
mostasis.

Recently we have shown that there is a high affinity
interaction of TSP with histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRGP)
(20) and with plasminogen (Pig) (21). HRGP, an a2-elycopro-
{ein of human plasma (22), i also found in platelet a-granles
and is seereted upon platelet activation (23). It isa protein of
‘multiple functions, including metal binding and perhaps trans-
port (24), immunoregulation (25), and modulation of hemo-
stasis, HRGP binds heparin sith bigh affinity and neutralizes
its anticoagulant effect (26, 27); it also binds Plg via that
protein's high affinity Wysine-binding site (LBS) (28) and thus
may serve as a physiological counterpart tothe antifibrinlytic
amino acids. The TSP-HRGP complex retains the heparin
binding and neutralizing function of HRGP (20), and the
‘TSP-Plg interaction, which is also mediated via the Plg LBS,
interferes with the ability of tissue plasminogen activator
(TPA) to activate Plg (21) on a fibrin clot. In this paper, we
report that TSP can form a trimolecular complex with HRGP.
‘and Pig and thatthe HGP and Pig within the macromolecular
‘complex retain functional capability. Such functional macro-
‘molecular complexes, when assembled on platelet as well as
‘other cellular surfaces, may modulate thrombotic as well as
fibrinolytic events.
