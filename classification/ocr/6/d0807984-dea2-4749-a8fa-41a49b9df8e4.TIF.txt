basis for the high apo A-l FCRs, seven subjects with low HDL-
{Cevel (31.04.3 mg/l) were eompared with three subjects
with high HDL-C levels (72.0:4.5 mg/dl). Each subject ce-

Introduction

Plasma concentrations of HDL cholesterol are significantly
‘and inversely related to risk fr developing coronary bear ie
‘ease (1-3) Individols with low plasma levels of HDL choles:
terol aso have reduced concentrations of apo A-t, and low
plasma apoA-I levels are also associated with increased rs for
‘coronary heart disease (4). Reduced plasma levels of apo Al
could result from decreased secretion Into plasma or ineresed
fractional removal from plasma ofthis apolipoprotein. Data
fiom several Iboratories have demonsrsed that increased
HDL apo Ad factional catabolic ates (PCRs)! and notre
«duced rates of apo A secretion nto plasma are associated with
low apo A-1 concentrations (5). Additionally, recent stdies
indicate that high apo A-1 FCRs are associated with low HDL.
Teves in subjects with either hypertigiycerdemia or normal
plasma tpyceride concentrations (6,7).

[Neither the mechanisms underlying aceleraed fractional
‘atabolism nor the sites of increased removal of apo Al from
plasma have been clearly delineated, Of interec inthis regard
re the studies by Glas et al. (8,9), which demonstrated that
the kidney is a major ste of HDL apo Al eatabolism and that
this organ can accumulate HDL apo Al without core lipid
components, These results sugested uptake and catabolism of
“ee” apo A-I by that organ. Apo Al can exchange among,
lipoprotein particies in vivo (10), indicating that it has the
bility to associate with and dscociate from HDI (as well a
‘othe lipoproteins). Indeed, fee apo A-t has been idenined in
plasma by several investigators (1114) and inereased fre po
‘AcTispreseat in plasma of patient wth renal failure (15). Apo
‘AcThas been shown tobe filtered by the glomerulus (16) and
thas been measured in urine fom normal individuals (17) and
fom nephrotic patients (18). The quantitative importance of
fhe kidney in apo AA catabolism was suggested by the recent
studies of Goldberg eal (19), which demonstrated that ine
‘reas apo Acl FCRS in hypertighyceridemie monkeys were
sociated with increased real extablisa ofthis apolipopro-
‘ein,

‘On the bass ofthese data, we hypothesized that increased
fractional catabolism of apo A-I in subjects with low plasma
HDL cholesterol levels results rom increased dissociation of
