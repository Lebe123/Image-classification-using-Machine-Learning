thats A single topical dose of either 0.5, 5, 10, 20, 100, or
200 nmeles DMBA, followed 1 week later by twice weekly
applications of 0.25% croton oil, inveed 0.3, 2.3, 6.0,
515, 62, and 15 popitlomas per mouse, respectively, at
25 weeks. Ono topes! application of 5, 40, of 200 mmoles
‘ONDA, followed by twice weekly applications of 17 nmoles
120telradecanoyiphorvalt3-acetate (TPR), produced
3.8, 15, and 26 papillomas per mouse at 20 weeks after
promaton. When OMBA was injected intraperitoneally in
mounts of 0.6, 1.2, 24, or 6.8 umoles and foowed by
twice weekiy TPA promotion, the mice developed 7.8, 11.8,
11.6, and 4. papilomas per mouse at 20 weeks. BA
