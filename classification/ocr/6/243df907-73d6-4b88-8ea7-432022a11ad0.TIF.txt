‘Summary

12nd E47 are two helix-loop-helix transcription t
tors that arise by alternative spicing of the E2A gene.
Both have been Implicated In the regulation of immu
‘noglobulin gene expression. We have now generated
E2A (-i-) mice by gene targeting. E2A-null mutant
tice fall o generate mature B cells. The arrest of B
‘cell development occurs at an early stage, since no
immunoglobulin DJ rearrangements can be datected
In homozygous mutant mice. While immunoglobulin
‘germline |, RAG-1, mb-1, CD19, and 25 transcripts a
‘dramatically reduced In fetal livers of E2A (-/-) mice,
B20 and "transcripts are present, but at low
Inaddition, we show that Paz-5 trans

cantly reduced In feta livers of E2A (-/-) mice, These
data suggest a crucial role for E2A products as central
regulators in early B cell differentiation,

 

 

  

  

   

 

   

 

 

Introduction

‘Both the humoral and celular immune responses depend
‘on properly functioning lymphocyte developmental path
ways. The moleculesthat determine the Band T cal devel
‘opmental pathways are largely unknown. However, the
regulation of immunoglobulin and T cell receptor (TCR)

 

{gene expression has boon extonsvoly studio’ and hes
been shown to be dependent on various sequence ele-
‘ments present in both the immunoglobulin and TCR gone
‘enhancers Ferrior ot al., 1990; Lonardo etal, 1987; Sen
and Balimore, 1986; Takeda et al., 1990; Tsao etal
1988). One class of such sits. the E box elements, has
Deen particularly well studiod and shares @ consensus
sequence of GCAGXTG (Church etl, 1985; Ephrussi
al, 1985). The proteins that bind to the E box elements
have recently boon identified and belong to a family of
DNA-binding proteins, designated as helictoop-helo (HLH)
proteins (Mure etal, 1994). These proteins share arogion
‘of homology in the basic helix-loop-helix domain anc theit
DNA-binding and dimerization domains (Mure et a
1989a, 1994),

Severalofthe class HLH proteins have been implicated
In the regulation of immunoglobulin gene expression. In
re-B, mature B, and plasma cells, tissue-specific com
plexes are present that bind to the wE2, wES, ues, xE,
‘and xE2 sites present in the immunoglobulin heavy and
light chain gene enhancers (Bain etal, 1993: Jacobs

» 1993; Murre et al. 1991). At the pre-B cel stage, it is
‘redominantly E2-2, andtoa lesser degroe E2A, that binds
{o the E box sites (Bain etal, 1993). However, during the
pre-B to mature B coll ansiton, E2-2 protein levels drop
‘and E2A levels increase. At the mature B col stage iis
predominantly E2A that binds tothe E box sites (Bain et
al, 1993). Further evidence that E2A products might be
involved in regulating Immunoglobulin gene expression
‘comes from studies in which overexpression of E47 in
re-T calls leads to induction of garmin immunoglobulin.
hheavy chain gone expression, immunoglobulin OJ re-
arrangement, and increased levels of Oct-2 and RAG gene
‘expression (Schiissol otal, 19918). In addition, vere
‘ression of £47 induces immunoglobulin enhancer activity
in non-B cells (Ruezinsky et a, 199%).

‘The function of E2A molecules in other developmental
pathwaysisless clear. E2A transcripts are presentinmost
‘embryonic and adult tssuos. High levels of E2A expres
sion can be detected in tho opendyma cell layer sur-
rounding the cerebral ventricles, the thymus, andthe ger-
‘minal contors ofthe adult sploen (Robers etal, 1989),
E2A.tke proteins are present in muscle- and pancreatic-
pectic complexes that bind to sts present in a number
cof muscle- and pancreatic-specific enhancers (Aronheim
tal, 1991; Lassar otal, 1991; Muro otal, 1991; Whelan
otal, 1990)

‘To determine the rol of E2A in these various develop

Pathways, we gonerated E2A-null mutant mice. B
cells of E2A (~/-) mice are arrested at an early stage of B
‘col diferentiation, fal to rearrange their immunaglabulin
‘gene segments, and contain dramatically reduced levels
‘f RAG-1, 28, mb-1, and CD19 transcripts. In adction,
ax-5 transcripts, which encode @ factor that has been
implicated in the regulation of @ numberof these genes,
are strongly reduced in (-/-) mice. These data demon-
strate a citical role for E2A in early B cal clittro
