ABSTRACT
‘The purpose af thia study was to identify the duration of exposure
ofislts to interleukin 18 IL-18) that results in irreversible damage
‘Trealment of rat islets for 16 h with I-18 results in an inhibition of
lucose-stimulated insulin secretion, mitochondrial aconitoze activ
thesia. The addition of N°-menomethyl-

IMA) or aminoguanidine to islets preincubated for 18
‘with IL1g, followed by continued culture for 8h (wath both NMNGA
and 11-16) results in the resovery of islet secretory function, acon-
itase activity, and protein synthesis. However, islet metabolic fune
tion is irreversibly inhibited afer a 36-h incubetion with IL-1P, asa

relates with the commitment of islets to destruction. Treatment of
Islets for 98h with IL-18 results in islet degeneration, NMBA, added

for 72 (with NMMA and IL-1), prevents islet degeneration, How
ever, NMBA added to islets 36h or 48 halter the addition of 1-1,
followed by continued culture for a total of 96h, does not prevent islet
<degeneration. Now messenger RNA expression appears tobe required
for islet recovery from IL-1f-induced damage as actinomyein D pre

vents the recovery of islet aconitase seliviy. Lastly, treatment of
hhuman islets with a combination of I-18 and interferon-y (IFN)
results in a potent inhibition of mitochondrial aconitase setivity
NMMA, when cocultured with IL-1p + TPNy, completely prevents
‘ytokine-induced inhibition of human islet aonitase activity NMA,
when udded to human islets pretreated for 18 with IL-p + IFNy,
stimulates the recovery of mitochondrial aonitase activity after an
‘additional 8 h incubation, These findings indicate that nitric oxide-
induced islet damage is reversible; however, prolonged production of
nitric oxide after a 86-h exposure ta IL-1) result in the irreversible
Inhibition of islet metabolic and secretory function. (ndacrinology

NSULIN-DEPENDENT diabetes mellitus is an autoim-

mune disease characterized by a local inflammatory re-
action in and around the pancreatic isles of Langerhans that
Jeads tothe selective dysfunction and destruction of insulin-
producing B-cells. Cytokines, released during insulitis, have
‘been proposed to participate in B-cell destruction during the
<development of autoimmune diabetes (1,2) Previous reports
have shown that islets incubated with the cytokine interleu-
kkin-1f (IL-1) express the inducible isoform of nitric oxide
synthase (iNOS) and produce high levels ofnitric oxide (3-7).
The cell appears to be the islet cellular source of INOS in
response to IL-1 (6, 7). The increased production of nitric
oxide by IL-1 treated islets correlates with a potent inhibition
of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion that is prevented
by NOS inhibitors, aminoguanidine (AG), and N°-mono-
methyl-t-arginine (NMMA; Refs. 3-7). Nitric oxide, which
targets iron-sulfur centers, inhibits the electron transport
chain at complexes 1 and Il and the Krebs cycle enzyme,
aconitase (8,9) IL-1 has been shown to inhibit islet aconitase
activity and the oxidation of glucose to CO,, resulting in a
reduced cellular level of ATP (6, 10, 11). The reduction in
mitochondrial funetion appears to be one mechanism by

which nitric oxide mediates the inhibitory effects of IL-1 on
insulin secretion by islets.

Although IL-1 stimulates islet and f-cell damage. the de-
structive effects of this cytokine on islet metabolic function
are reversible. Ratislets incubated with IL-1 for 1Sh require
a 4-day incubation in cytokine free media to restore normal
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (12, 13) This window of
functional recovery can be reduced to 8 h by the inhibition
‘of iNOS (14), The addition of NMMA to islets preincubated
for 18 h with IL-1, followed by an S-h incubation in the
presence of both NMMA and IL-1, results in a complete
recovery of insulin secretion (14). Recovery of insulin secre-
tion function is paralleled by a simultaneous recovery of
‘mitochondrial aconitase activity (14). The aim ofthis study
was to identify the length of exposure of islets to IL-1 that
leads to irreversible inhibition of insulin secretion and to
determine whether the irreversible inhibition of insulin se-
‘cretion correlates with an irreversible inhibition of islet met-
abolic function.
