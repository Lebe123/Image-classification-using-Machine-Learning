Background: An association between exposure to environ-
‘mental tobacco smoke (ETS) and tung cancer risk has been
suggested. To evaluate this possible association better, re-
searchers need more precise estimates of risk, the relative
contribution of different sources of ETS, and the effect of|
ETS exposure on different histologic types of lung cancer. To
address these issues, we have conducted a case-control study
of lung cancer and exposure to ETS in 12 centers from seven
European countries. Methods: A total of 650 patients with
Tung cancer and 1542 control subjects up to 74 years of age
‘were interviewed about exposure to ETS, Neither ease sub-
Jects nor control subjects had smoked more than 400 ciga-
rettes in ther lifetime, Results: ETS exposure during child-
hhood was not associated with an increased risk of lung
cancer (odds ratio [OR] for ever exposure = 0.78; 95% con-
fidence interval [CT] = 0.64-0.96). The OR for ever exposure
‘0 spousal ETS was 1.16 (95% CI = 093-144). No clear
‘dose-response relationship could be demonstrated for cumu-
lative spousal ETS exposure. The OR for ever exposure to
workplace ETS was 1.17 (98% CI =0.94-145), with possible
‘evidence of increasing risk for inereasing duration of expo-
sure. No increase in risk was detected in subjects whose
‘exposure to spousal or workplace ETS ended more than 15
‘years earlier. Ever exposure to ETS from other sources was
not associated with lung cancer risk. Risks from combined
‘exposure to spousal and workplace ETS were higher for
‘squamous cell carcinoma and small-cell carcinoma than for
adenocarcinoma, but the differences were not statistically
significant. Conclusions: Our results indicate no association
between childhood exposure to ETS and lung cancer risk.
We did find weak evidence of a dose-response relationship
between risk of lung cancer and exposure to spousal and
workplace ETS. There was no detectable risk after cessation
of exposure. [J Natl Cancer Inst 1998;90:1440-0}

tal tobacco stoke (ETS) and tung cancer. Several authors and
regulatory agencies have concluded that causal link has been
established (e.g. see (/~3)], whereas some authors consider that
bias and confounding factors constitute a plausible explanation
for the observed association (e.g, see 4]. The available studies
‘are—in most cases—too small to adequately assess the magni-
tude of the effect and to address specific aspects, such as the
shape of the dose-response relationship, the effect of cessation
‘of exposure, the importance of multiple sources of ETS expo-
sure, nd the interaction of ETS exposure with other risk factors
‘of lung cancer. Furthermore, celatively few studies of such ex-
posure are available from Europe (5-10). Characteristic of to-
bacco smoking in European countries are the mixed consump:
tion of blond and black tobacco cigereties (J/) and the low
prevalence—at least in the past—of smoking among women
‘compared with men (12).
