Tissue on Sephadex G-10 showed a peak eluting atthe sane
position as the synthetic tetrapeptide, a position diferent
from that of MIF-1 (Pro-Leu-Glj-NH) (10,1). High per-
formance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of brain tissue
{rom which the pineal, hypothalamus, and pituitary had been
emoved confirmed recently the natural occurrence ot
‘Tyr-MIF-1 (unpublished observations). In_addtion, the
presence of saturable, specifi, high afinty binding sites for
‘Tyr MIP-I has been demonstrated in rat brain; MIF-1 does
not effectively compete for these sites [23] Ina test of pas-
sive avoidance, administration of Tyr-MIF-1 resulted in sig
niffeant changes not seen with MIF-1 at the dose tested (8),
whereas significant changes in reserpine-induced
hypothermia in mice were seen with MIF-1 but not ‘Tyt-
MIF-1 (9). Although braia enzymes can degrade Tye-MIF-1
into MIF-1 [18}, unpublished observations indicate that the
elects of injected Tyr-MIF-1 are not mediated by conver-
sion in blood to MIF-1. Together these results demonstrate
thatthe ozcurence of Tyr-MIT-1 cannot be accounted for bY
MIF-I and raise the possiblity that atleast some of the 2c-
tions of MIF-1 might not be shared by Tyr-MIF-1.

‘One of the actions MIF-1 can exert is that of an opiate
antagonist. MIF-1 has been found to block the aatineciep:
tive effect of opiates after acute (1, 6, 7,12, 13} orehronie 3)
administration. ‘These actions did'not Seem to be mediated
by mu or delta opiate receptors (13,16). MIF- also exerted
naloxone-ike actions on body temperature (22) and drinking
[19], but not on inhibition of the actions of Leavenkephain
on Blood pressure oF heart rate (21). It was not obvious,
therefore, whether oF not TyrMIF-1 would exert the samme
actions 3s MIF-I inthe tail-ick test

METHOD
Preliminary Experiments

In preliminary experiments, the following variables were
briefly examined: dose of MIF-1, dose of morphine sulfate,
time after injection of MIF-1, time after injection of mor-
phine sulfate, time of day, time exposed to heat, and inten-
sity of heat. Diluent (0.9% NaCl acidified to 0.01 M with
acetic acid) and, occasionally, naloxone (generously pro-
vided by Endo Labs) were used for comparison with MIF-I.

  

Experiment 1

Male, albino ICR mice weighing between 17-20 g at the
time of the experiment were obtained from Charles River
Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Each mouse was tested ina
2.5x3 em Plexiglas tube with 2 em (I em from tip) of
exposed tail covering small opening through which heat
emanated from a nichromte thermal wire. A digital electronic
timer was activated manually. Removal of the tail (tail-flick)
from the grooved tray closed a photoelectric circuit and de-
activated the timer. A rheostat maintained the heat so that
the basal latency was about 4.5 sec. Each trial automatically
fended at 17 sec.

‘Ten min before injection of morphine, each mouse re-
ceived an intraperitoneal (TP) injection (10 ml/kg) of a freshly
prepared, coded solution of MIF-L, Tyr-MIF-1, or diluent
‘Twenty mice were used at each IP dose of 0 (diluent), 0.001,
0.01, 0.4, 1.0, and 10.0 mg/kg; no mouse was used for more
than oe dose of any solution. Immediately before injection
‘of peptide or diluent, a single basal determination of latency
was made. Ten mi later, morphine sulfate was injected at a
dose of 12.5 mglkg, IP and after 30 min (40 min after pei
‘oF diluent), three consecutive readings of latency were
taken. These latencies as well as the number of mice reduc-
ing theic latencies to a mean of 12 sec or less (responders)
