THE RESPONSE OF MURINE SPLENIC LYMPHOCYTES TO
CONCANAVALIN A AND TO CO-STIMULATOR'

‘The blastogenic and mitogenic response of murine
splenic lymphocytes to concanavalin A and the response
of the resulting blasts to a lymphokine co-stimulator
preparation was cxamined with an electronic particle
counting and sizing apparatus (Coulter Counter and
Channelizer). Mitogenesis, as determined by increase in
cell number, correlated well with the time-integrated
uptake of tritiated thymidine. It was found that co-stim-
ulator was highly mitogenic to the lectin-induced blasts,
and that the cells appearing in response to it were uni-
formly large (co-stimulator blasts). Furthermore, the
eventual increase in cell number was proportional to the
co-stimulator concentration, at least for the concentra-
tions, cell numbers, and incubation times examined. This,
relatively simple assay that uses the Coulter Counter
and Channelizer is therefore capable of substituting for
serial measurements of tritiated thymidine uptake and
yields additional information on the volume spectra of
responding cells, as well as forming the basis for assay-
ing co-stimulator activity.

‘The co-stimulator blasts were found to be capable of
killing a wide variety of allogenele as well as syngeneic
concanavalin A induced blasts. The level of killing in a
Sehr “'Cr release assay varied between 9% (for the syn-
geneic caso) and 24% of the maximum obtained by water
lysis.

 

 

 

‘The proliferation oflymphocytes in eeponse to concanavalin
‘A (Con A) has been shown to be mediated by the release of a
|ymphokine (co-stimulator) (1). Although it has been shown to
‘be nonmitogenic to resting lymphocytes (1), we wil show here
that co-timulator causes a strong proliferation ina cell popt-
lation previously stimulated by Con A, and that this prolifer-
ating population contains cytotoxic cells. Its now that when
spleen oF lymph node cells are mixed with allogeneic tumor
call, membranes, or normal calls, killer cells may ar may not
‘be produced (2-10), depending presumably on the ability of the
allogeneic calls to stimulate the production of co-stimalator in
the responding cell population. The addition of previously
prepared co-stimulator leads to # cytotoxic response to the

Otherwise nonstimulatory allogeneic eels (2) or membranes (3),

It seems likely then, that the proliferation of killer cells in
response to elther the nonspecific stimulus of a mitogen, or to
‘the specific stimulus of an allogeneic call, requires co-stiraulator,
In this paper, we have used a Coulter Counter to show the
change in volume spectra and numbers of spleen or lymph node
cells present in a response to Con A, and in the numbers of
large cells that follow a subsequent addition of co-stimulator.
Results have been correlated with tritiated thymidine uptake.
It is shown that the most substantial cell proliferation is in
response to co-stimulator, and is limited to the large cells in the
volume spectrum. Furthermore, it appears that these large
cells, which we term “co-stimulator blasts,” include populations,
‘that ae capable of rapid killing ofboth allogeneic and syngeneic
“Con A blasts.”

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Mice. Two to 4-month-old male C57BL/6 (H-2"), BALB/c
(1.24), DBA\(H-29, A?/J (H.2"), SIL (H-2), and C3H (H-25)
‘ice bred in our animal care facility were used.

‘Medium. Eagle minimum essential medium (No. 410-1500,
Grand Ialand Biological Co., Grand Island, N. ¥.) supplemented,
with 100 units penicillin and 100 ug streptomycin per ml, 36
mM NaHCO,, 10“ M 2-mereaptoethanol, and 10% fetal calf
‘serum (FCS) was used. This medium will be referred to as
MEM.

Preparation of co-stimulator. Co-stimulator was prepared
from BALB/c spleen cells (SC)? by a modification of the
‘method of Shaw et al. (11), Briefly, 8 x 107 SC from normal
BALB/c mice were suspended in 8 ml MEM containing 2-
‘mereaptoethanol minus FCS, and placed in a 75-cm Falcon
flask containing 80 pg Con A (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis,
Mo) in an additional 8 mi of MEM. Flasks were incubated at
37°C for 2 hr in an atmosphere of 79.5% Nz, 8.5% O;, and 12%
CO,, then rinsed with three 10-ml aliquots of MEM. Twelve
rililiters of MEM minus FCS were then added to each flask,
‘and they were cultured an additional 18 hr at 37°C.

‘The cell supernatants were then pooled and centrifuged 10
‘in at 1200 x G. One percent FCS was added to the superna-
tant, which was then concentrated to 10% of its original volume.
‘The co-stinulator preparation was filter sterilized and stored
at -20°C,

Con A stimulation. BALB/c and C57BL/6 SC were cultured
{or periods of 1 to 6 days with Con A. The cells were suspended
at 25 x 10° calls plus 8 xg Con A/ml/well in Falcon multi-well
tisoue culture plates (No. 2008, Oxnard, Calif) and incubated at
37°C im the gas mixture described previously.

Co-stimulator-treated cultures. Ten- to 240-fold dilutions of
