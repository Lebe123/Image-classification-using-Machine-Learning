its own set of cytokines and mediating separate effector

1984), Type 1 Th cells (Tht) produce intorteukin2 (IL-2),

Cells, eosinophils, and immunoglobulin G1 (IgG) and IgE
antibodies and possibly suppressing coll mediated immu-
nity (Powrie and Cottman, 1993; Mosmann and Cotiman,
1880). Because thor rospoctve cytokines act antagonia
cally, these two cell populations mutually regulate the
function ofthe other (Sader and Paul, 1994).

‘The ditferentiation of Th precursor (Thp) calls into Tht
‘or Th2 cells has important biologic implications in terms
‘of susceptibility or resistance toa particular disease. In
Leishmania major parasitic infections, there is reciprocal

specific auloimmune diseases, including experimental al-
lergic encephalomyettis (EAE), aro induoed by auloreac-
tive Tht cells (Kuchroo et sl, 1989; Baron eta, 1993)
Furthermore, regulatory Tcellsthat suppress the develop:

inhibit the actions of tho inflammatory Tht cytokines, sug

‘and cytokines may prevent EAE and other autoimmune
‘iseases maciated by Tht cols.

In spite ofthe importance of Th lineage commitment in
‘isoase, mechanisms that termine whother an immune
response will be dominated by Tht or The cells are not
well understood (Seder and Paul, 1994). The dominant
factors that control the dtferentiation of Tht and Th2 cells
‘rom Thp cells may be cytokines. Thus, IFNy and IL-&

Inhibiting Th2 development, while IL-4 has the opposite

Intate Tht versus Th2 ditferentiaion are unknown, a

Induction and activation of T ymphooytes requie two
signals rom antigen-prosenting cols (APCs). Te first sig-

molecules expressed on APCs. OF the known costimula

to be the most potent. The B7 costimulatory pathway in-
