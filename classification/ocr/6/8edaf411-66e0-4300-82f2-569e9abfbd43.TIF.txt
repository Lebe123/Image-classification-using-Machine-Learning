‘Three chemically-induced precancerous mammary hyperplasias, independently isolated in
BALB/e mice, all contained mouse tumor virus (MMTV) proviral DNA integrated
{nto a common region in chromosomal DNA, designated Int (Formerly Int-H, Gray et al,
1986). This site was cloned from a hyperplastic outgrowth (D2) into lambda phage. A 1.7 Kb
Hind Il DNA fragment, which flanks the 5 end of the MMTV insert, was generated from the
cloned Int-5 region, This fragment was used as probe (IH.-2) to localize Int-5 to mouse
chromosome 9. The IH-2 sequence was highly conserved in DNA of several mammalian
species including man, in three other widely divergent vertebrate phyla, and in C. elegans.

“The Int region, containing 5.6 Kb 5’ and 12.8 Kb 3' to the MMTV integration site in D2,
‘was cloned in EMBL-3 from a BALB/c genomic DNA library. CDNA complementary to poly
A” lactating mammary gland RNA, annealed with $st-1 fragments spanning most of the
BALB/c Int clone. The highest level of In-5 specific poly A* mRNA was detected in D2
tumor. Lactating mammary gland and D2 nyperplasic alveolar nodule contained 5-fold less
Int-5 RNA while liver contained 8.fld less In!5 RNA. In-5 cDNA (TH-3) annealed with two
RNA species of approximately 33 and 4.0Kb. These data are consistent withthe hypothesis
that Int-$ contains an oncogene, different from any other previously described, involved in
early events in some models of chemical carcinogenesis.

INTRODUCTION of two distinct loci, Int-1_ and Int-2, located on

‘mouse chromosomes 15 and 7 respectively (Nusse et

Mammary cancer in mice can be induced by infec-
tious mammary tumor viruses (MMTV) or by chemi-
cals (including mammotrophic hormones, MTH)
(Nandi and McGrath, 1973). The virus does not
carry @ transduced oncogene but rather acts as an
insertional mutagen (Cohen et al, 1979b; Nusse and
‘Varmus, 1982; Peters et al, 1983); integration of the
Provirus into chromosomal DNA of the host cell can
specifically alter the expression of adjacent cellular
{genes involved in growth regulation (Varmus, 1982)
In the majority of MMTV- induced tumors of some
mouse strains, a provirus can be detected in either

al,, 1984; Peters et al, 1984). Each region spans at
least 25 kilobases of DNA and includes a cellular
gene whose expression is activated by the presence
of a provirus (Dickson, 1984; Nusse et al, 1984; Van
Coyen and Nusse, 1984). The insertion mutation of
int-1 and Int-2 by MMTV provirus does not appear
to be stage specific (Morris et al,, 1990), This muta-
tion is observed at the earliest identifiable stages of
adenocarcinoma development as well as during the
progression to later stages of tumors
(Mortis et al, 1990). Int-l and Int-2 are highly con-
served genes (Casey et al, 1986; Rijsewijk et al,
1987) and represent cellular proto-oncogenes with
intriguing properties: Intl is homologous to the
“wingless" gene in Drosophila and probably is
involved in embryonic pattern formation (Rijsewijk
