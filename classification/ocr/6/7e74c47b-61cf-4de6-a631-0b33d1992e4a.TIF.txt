‘Two independent lines of work, each
pursuing cellular oncogenes, have con-
verged over the last several years. Ini-
ally, the two research areas confronted
problems that were ostensibly uncon-

ected. The first focused on the mecha
nisms by which a variety of animal reo.
viruses are able. to transform infected

 

 

‘mechanisms responsible for tumors of
soaviral origin, such as those human
‘uumors traceable to chemical causes. We
pow realize that common molecular de-
‘erminants may be responsible for ni
mors of both classes. These determi-
‘ant, the cellular oncogenes, constitute
a functionally, heterogeneous group of
‘genes, members of which may cooperate
‘with ove another in order to achieve the
transformation of cells.

Rerreviras-Associated Oncogene

‘Aa iniial insight into eeUular onco-
‘genes came from study of Rous sarcoma
virus (RSV), Retroviruses such as RSV
have been studied intensively for the
past decade, in part because of their

‘Summary. Two dazen celular proto-oncogenes have been discovered to date
through the study of revoviruses and the use of gene transler. They form a structurally
