INTRODUCTION

Previous studies disclosed that addition of nicotine to rabbits’ sonic and mye
‘cardial cells in vitro caused successively increased cytoplasmic granulation, vacuoisa-
tion, nuclear pyknosis. and cytolysis. Aortic “endothelial” celle were more vulnerable
than ““Sbrocytic™ cells. Myocardial cells were more vulnerable thin spindle cells
which grew from aortic explants. Cells ftom hypercholesteremic rabbits were more
sensitive than analogous cells trom normocholesteremic animals. Inhibition of pro-
liferation and cellular alterations were commensurate with nicotine concentration
and length of exposure to nicotine. as reported by Kokubu and Pollak (1962)

In discussing the posible link betweent smoking and vascular disease. one must
beat in mind that nicotine is but one of multiple constituents of tobacco and tobacco:
smoke. We decided to utilize tissue cultutes to investigate this link, in spite of the
obvious difficulty to extrapolate in vitro studies and én wiv conditions. Extension of
tissue culture experiments to substances other than ‘nicotine was imperative. This
report concerns the effect of cigarette smoke condensate on rabbits’ cardiovascular

  

 

 

 

 

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS

‘The culture techniques employed in this study’ were the same as those wed berore
by Kokobu and Pollak (1961). Composite cigarette smoke condensate was obtained
from a source conforming to the standards of the Scientific Advisory Board of the
Tobacco Industry Research Committee, Eath mm of cigarette smoke condensate (CSC)
prepared from five regular. standard size cigarettes contained 15 mp of nicotine (N
Following the same recommended method of preparation. comparable condensates
‘were prepared by us from repular vntipped, denicotinized untipped. Alter Upped. and
Genicotinized filter tipped cigaretes.

Since the toxicty of pure nicotine for i wtro cardiovascular cells from rabbits
thad been determined previously by Kokubu and Pollak (1962). the stength of the
various preparations of cigarette smoke condensates was adjusted on the basi of
nicotine ‘content. Thus, any effect of CSC exceeding tha of compartble nicotine
solution could be ascribed to substances other than nicotine.

‘The intial preparation consisted of 100 ml of Eagle's basal medivm with 0.66.1
