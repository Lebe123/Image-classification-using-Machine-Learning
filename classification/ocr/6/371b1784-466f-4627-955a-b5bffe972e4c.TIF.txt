Abstract The raf gene encodes one ofthe most rapidly induced
‘neuronal mRNAs identified in NGF-treated PCI2 cells. Maximal
inhibition of VGF mRNA induction was achieved using K-252a,
an inhibitor of the NGF-receptor Trk tyrosine kinase, and by
‘mutating both ¥490 (SHC association site) and Y7RS (PLC-y1
association site) of Trk Inhibitors of the NGF-activated protein
{kinase N (PKN) were found to partially and in some cases tran-
siently block VGE induction by NGF while in PKA-deficient
PCI2 cells, VGF induction by NGF was comparable to that
‘observed in parental PC12 cells. The binding of NGF to Trk
‘therefore activates redundant signal transduction pathways which
converge to regulate raf gene expression,

otroduction

 

In the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF) and basic
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) but not epidermal growth
factor (EGF), PCI2 pheochromocytoma cells differentiate into
sympathetic neuron-like cells (1). Treatment of PC12 cells with
[NGF results inthe rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of maltiple
cellular proteins 2] and the stimulation of several second mes-
Senger pathways through the actions of a number of tyrosine
and serine/threonine kinases (3). The importance of protein
phosphorylation in the mechanism of action of NGF has been
reinforced by the identification of the product of the rk tyro-
sine kinase protooncogene as the high affinity NGF receptor
[4.5]. and the demonstration that Tek is a necessary component
of the NGF signaling pathoray that is required for neurite
outgrowth and the promotion of PC12 cell survival (6)

NGF-treatment stimulates p21" GTP-binding activity, caus-
ing protonged p21™ and ERK activation in comparison to

EGF, a growth factor which does not cause neuronal differen-
tiation of PCI2 cells [7]. Selective inhibition of protein kinase
activity through the application of purine analogs inhibits
NGF-promoted neurite regeneration and the NGF-regulated
serine/threonine protein kinase N (PKN) but does not block
several other effects of NGF [8-10] suggesting that the develop-
tment and maintenance of a neuronal phenotype results from
the complex regulation of « number of protein kinases. Insight
into the process of neuronal differentiation may be obtained
through study of gene products such as VGF {11} which are
rapidly activated more robustly by NGF than by EGF. in
contrast to transcripts of the immediate early genes fos, un,
and =i268 (NGFI-A), which appear to be induced similarly by
cither NGF, EGF, or serum stimulation {12}. In PC12 cells,
YGF mRNA levels increase atleast 15-30-fold after 3-6 h of
[NGF treatment and return to basal levels after approximately
48 h (13,14), Induction of raf gene expression is mimicked by
activation of a Sre-Ras-Raf cascade in PC12 cells (15), and is
partially blocked by protein synthesis inhibitors [16,17] and
downregulation of protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent path-
ways [14] Here we utilize a numberof protein kinase inhibitors,
several PC12-derived cell lines that express wildtype or mutant
forms of Trk, and a PKA-defcient PC12 cell ine to characte

ize the relative contributions of specific signal transduction
pathways to the regulation of vgf gene expression by NGF.
