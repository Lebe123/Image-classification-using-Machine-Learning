ABSTRACT Interleukin 4 (IL-4 induces the expression of |
{IgG and TeX in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated B cells. Previ-
‘ous studies have suggested that heavy-chain class switching
may be regulated by inereasing the accessibility of specie
‘Switch regions to switch recombinases, In ths study, we huve
tused an RNase protection assay’ to demonstrate that IL-3

uduces expression of germline 7/1 teanserips in B cells within
4 hr of culture; indnetion is dose-dependent and is inhibited by
interferon y. UL-d alone is capable of inducing the expression
of germline yl transcripts in small, resting B cells, but
lipopolysaccharide enhances expression. The germline tran
scripts are the same size (1.8 and 3.4 kilobases) asthe secreted
and membrane forms of the functional 1 mRNAs and pre-
sumably result from the splicing of an upstream switeh-rezion
exons) to the 74 constant-region exonts). These data strongly
support the “accessibility” model for the regulation of isotype
switching and suggest tht lymphokines suchas Hl-4 may direct
specific switch events by transcriptional vetivation of the
corresponding switch regions,

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

  

 

 

<ell<lerived lymphokines play an important role in the
regulation of immunoglobulin isotype switching. Interleukin
4 (IL-4) induces the expression of IgG (1) and IgE. (2) and
suppresses the expression of IgM. IsG3, and lgG2 in mito-
gen-activated B cells (3). IL-4 prepares resting, surface
IgG-negative B cells to secrete IgG1 in response to subse
‘quent stimulation with bacterial ipopolysaccharide (LPS) (4)
and enhances the precursor frequency of IgG1-seereting cells
(5.5). Ihe IL-4mediated switch accompanied by increased
transeription of 1 heavy-chain constant-region (Cy) genes
(7) and increased steady-state levels of pl MRNA ().
Heavy-chain class switching in terminally differentiated B
cells is characterized by DNA rearrangement that juxtae
poses the assembled variable-region gene from the 4/6
{transcription unit to a downstream Cy gene with deletion of
the intervening Cy, genes (9.10). Studies of hybridomas (11,
and normal murine R cells (13) indicate that switeh
recombination is directed to the same switch region (S} on
both the productive and the nonproductive Cy alleles. sue:
gesting that itis @ directed, rather than stochastic, process
{Q0). In some instances. genes targeted for rearrangement are
lranseriptionally activated prior to recombination (14. 18),
and recent studies have indicated that mitogens and lym
pphokines may directly regulate isotype switehing through
{ranseriptional activation of germ-line genes prior t switch
recombination (16-18),
In this report. we show that IL-4 induces the expression of
eeruline yl transcripts in LPS-stimulated B cells within 4 hr

of culture. Induction is dose-dependent and is inhibited by
interferon y (IFN-7). IL-4 alone is capable of inducing the
germ-line yl transcripts in small, resting B cells, but LPS
enhances expression, The gerov-lne transcripts are the same
size as the membrane and secreted forms ofthe functional yl
mRNAs but contain sequences 5’ of Sy that are presumably
spliced to the C,, exons,

MATERIALS AND METHODS:

Animals. Specific pathogen-free female BALB/c mice
Were obtained from Simonsen Laboratories, (Gilroy, CA
and were housed in laminar-low animal isolation hoods, All
‘animals were used at 8-16 weeks of age.

Antibodies, Lymphokines, and Reagents, [L-4 was purified
by affinity chromatography on Sepharose conjugated anti-
IL-4 (11B11) (1) from culture supernatants of either EL-4
(murine lymphoma) cells stimulated with phorbol 12.
myristate 13-acetate or S19 (Spodoptera frugiperda ovary)
cells infacted with a recombinant baculovirus (generously
provided by W. Paul, National Institute of Arthritis and
Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD) containing the murine
IL-4 gene. One unit of IL-4 activity is defined as the amount
required for half-maximal stimulation of PHithymidine
corporation by purified splenic B cells. stimulated with
Sepharose-conjugated goat anti-mouse 6 chain (1 mg/ml of
Sepharose) in a 200-n! culture as previously deseribed (1).
‘Marine recombinant 1FN-y was a gift from Genentech.

Preparation and Culture of Resting B Cells. T-cell-lepieted
spleen cells were prepared by treatment with monocional
anti-Thy-i.2 (HO.13.4) and baby rabbit complement (Pel:
Freeze Biologicals, Rogers, AR) in a two-step procedure at
Cand 37°C, respectively (30), Small, resting B cells density
> 1.085 g/ml) were isolated by Percoll density. gradient

RNA Preparation, Total cellolar RNA was prepared from
cells by @ modification of the method of Chirgwin etal. (22)
‘or by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) Iysis and hot phenol
extraction (29), Poly(A)” RNA was purified by a single eycle
of oligo(dT) cellulose chromatography (24), RNA. prepa
tions were quantitated by UV spectrophotometry
