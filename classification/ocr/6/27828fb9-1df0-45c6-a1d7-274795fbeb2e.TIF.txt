Increased amount of publications and advocate advertising on the health
effects of smoking has led to the growing concern of nonsmokers on potential
effects of passive exposure to cigarette smoke. To assess this potential
exposure, researchers have used several scientific instruments, prevalent
‘among them are individual self reporting or interview questionnaires. Asking
people how many cigarettes they smoke, or nonsmokers how many cigarettes are
smoked near them, may seem a reasonable approach. However discrepancies
between estimated consumption through questionnaire surveys, and actual number
consumed have been reported around 30 percent, !»? It is suspected that a
large portion of the discrepancy is due to the tendency of respondents to
systematically underreport benavidr or events which may be perceived as
undesirable. Although it has not been investigated, there may also be a
tendency of nonsmokers to overreport their perceived exposure to cigarette
smoke. Correction factors have been developed and used on smoking data to
approximate actual rates.? If nonsmokers also show a systematic reporting
bias {t may be possible to develope another set of such correction factors.

There is a need for focused research to determine the reliability of
using questionnaires for assessing passive exposure to cigarette smoke. IITRI
proposes an investigation to assess the reliability of self reporting ques~
tionnaires. Specifically we will address questionnaires on smoking behavior,
which are typically used in indoor air quality studies, for assessing possible
exposure to cigarette smoke of non smokers in public environments. The
investigation will attempt to determine the variation around a “true number"
of reported cigarettes consumed by smokers and reported exposed to by

nonsmokers.
