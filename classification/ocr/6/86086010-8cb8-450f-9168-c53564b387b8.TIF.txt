Incroduction,
In the United Sutes and other countries there

‘US wurveys show thet in 1987, 90% of clone
‘non-smokers and 89% of exrmakers a well
80% of current smokers were in favour of

United Suter, however, the occupational

‘The tobacco industry has argued that rettrice
tions on smoking indoors are unnecessary. Tt
argues, for example, that data on the health
effects’ of ETS are’ inconclusive; that non-
smokers are exposed © wivial amounts of
tobacco smoke compared with smokers; that
‘other indoor pollutants are far more important
than ETS; and that solutions other, than
stringent workplice policies should be pursued
= for example, using “coramen courtesy” to
‘accommodate the aceds of both smokers and
‘non-smokers, providing designsted stroking

‘The tobacco industry suggests that non

‘Davis «raf concluded that these Gndings show
