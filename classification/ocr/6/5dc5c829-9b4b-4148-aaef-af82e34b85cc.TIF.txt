‘ubiquitous nature Of one electron reduction reactions in
enzymic processes which regulate human metabolism
“Although the importance of such fre radical reactions cannot
bbe questioned, their role in the development of disease 8
controversial. Without doubt, one ofthe major reasons fr this
‘apparent impasse in the field of fee radical pathology isthe
bience of adequate measurement of in vivo free radial
‘activity. The following review atempts 10 focus on this
problem by describing both the dcect and indirect techniques
employed to measure oxygen radical activity in vi¥0,

‘The Source of Free Radical Activity In Vivo
‘The biochemistry of radical reactions in human metabolism is
inexsicably linked to oxygen and the term oxygen radical
commonly used to describe intermedtes of the four one:
lecton reduction steps converting oxen to water,

Superoxide (O;~ )isthe frst one electron reduction product
‘of oxygen Hyaogen peroxide and the highly feactve
hydroxyl radical (OFF) ate the other two species which ave
‘commonly referred to, collcively, as reactive oxygen species
(ROS), with hydrogen peroxide the nontadieal species ofthe
three,

‘One of the most important agents of oxygen toxicity isthe
superonide radical, At physiological pHs Wis a fly strong,
‘educing agent and a weak oxidising agent. 1 dismutates
spontaneously into hydrogen peroxide. and also by virtue of ts
reducing properties can distocate protein-bound inn, pat
‘ularly from ron storage molecules such as ferstin.*#

‘Once iron in its protein bound iron) form is reduced to
iron( tt) by superoxide, the Fet* can then interreact with
hydrogen peroxide via a Fenton reaction to prsuce the highly
destructive hydroxy radical (OH). Hydroxy radicals that are
believed to be formed in vivo ae thought to havea steady sate
concentration of between 10-* and 10-* a. This means that
{hey can travel barely a few Angstroms in any direction before
eating with another biomolecule. Understandably. this
sccounts for why this radical ls very diffiul to detect under
complex biological conditions, and particularly in vivo. So how
ddo'we measure such activity tn vivo and decide with both
‘confidence and accuracy that oxygen radial species ate
produced in certain disease processes? There are esscaially
Iwo ways to do this: either by direct procedures, which

‘One other way i which specific radicals can be measure is
by light emission or chenuluninescenee. This technique can be
applied 10 identification of a range of radical species by
Selective use of interference filters. Characteristic emisions
‘an be measured." For instance, singlet oxygen has two types
fffuminescence. one at 1-27 ya and dimol luminescence at 64
{and 704 nm. Excited carbonyls denoted as RO" emit between
380 and 460 nm. Luminot (S-amino-2,Shydeopiihalcine
