: Tobacco Smoke on Nonsmokers

J.R. White

Introduction .

‘There is increasing evidence that more smokers than nonsmokers
die prematurely from coronary disease. But nonsmokers who
involuntarily inhale residual tobacco smoke (any and all smoke from
tobacco, whether from the cigarette, cigar or pipe or from the
exhalation of the smoker) experience nasal congestion, eye irritation,
headache, nausea and gastric upset, and the smoke can be particu:
larly harmful to nonsmokers with cardiorespiratory and allergy
problems, a sizable group of between 8 and 34 million Americans
(Zussman, Journal of Asthma Research, June 1974, and Banzhaf,
Today's Health, April 1972).

Definitive evidence that inhaling residual smoke constitutes a
health hazard to otherwise healthy nonsmokers has not as yet
appeared in the literature. However, a reasonable hypothesis is that
when a nonsmoker is exposed to residual smoke, he will experience
adverse physiological resporises.

This paper presents an analysis of cardiac, pulmonary and neural
changes caused by inhalation of residual tobacco smoke. These
changes are simultaneously reflected in each of the following
parameters: ‘

1. Minute volume (VE)

2. Oxygen consumption (VO2)

3. Oxygen consumption/kg

4. Carbon dioxide production (VCO2)
5.RQ.

6. Respiratory rate

7. Perspiration production

8. Heart rate

9. Systolic blood pressure
