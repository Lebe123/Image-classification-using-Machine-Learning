Cadmium, a non-essential, potentially
Summary oxic metal, accumulates’ in buman
tissues with increasing age. Because many foods
contain cadmium, the diet bas been considered the
major source for man, Cigarette tobacco contains
appreciable amounts of cadmium, which on burning
‘passes into the smoke, Analysis of necropsy material
as showin that non-smokers accumulate smaller
amounts of cadmium in their organs than smokers. In
addition, the accumulation in smokers is related to
the number of pack-years smoked. Itis concluded that
tobazco constitutes a major source for cadmium
‘accumulation in man§ and in heavy smokers, inhalation.
‘of the cadmium contained in tobacco smoke may make
f greater contribution fo the total body burden than
the amount derived by dietary intake.
