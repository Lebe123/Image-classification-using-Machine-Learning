‘Summary

‘The urine of a cigarette smoker who excretes exceptionally mutagen urine was
analyzed for several factors affecting mutagenicity. S. yphimurium strain TASS was
always more sensitive to XAD-2 urine concentrates than TA10O. With TASS, as high
‘a 85 revertats per milo urine were produced. It was observed that incubation with
{e-xlucuronidase was nat required for expression of mutagenicity but that a complete
‘59 mix was needed to convert the material in the concentrate 10 the ultimate
‘mutagenic species. TLC and HPLC separation of the XAD-2 urine concentrate
resulted in the identification of tace amounts of the bladder carcinogen, 2-
amioonaphuhalene (f-naphthylamine) and a considerable amount of a possible
metabolite of 2-aminonaphhalene, 2-amino-7-naphthol. The identity of the com-

 

‘Studies that involve the mutagenicity of chemicals or metabolites of chemicals
excreted in the urine of humang also usually detect products of cigaette smoking
(Yamasaki and Ames, 1977; Baden etal, 1980; Gelbart and Sontag, 1980). Often,
individuals who are cigarette smokers have been used as postive controls in such
studies. Although cigarete smoke has been chemically fractionated and the muta-
genicity and/or carcinogenicity of many of its components ascertained (Stedman,
1968; Falk, 1977; Florin et a, 1980), the actwal metabolic products of cigarette
smoke have not been identified.
