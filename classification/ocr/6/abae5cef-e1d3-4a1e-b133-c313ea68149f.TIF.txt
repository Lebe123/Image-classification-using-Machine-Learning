If the nv gene of spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) is replaced by a eDNA encoding a constitutively active
form of the erythropoietia receptor, EPO-R(R129C), the resultant recombinant virus, SFFVcEPO-R, induces
transient thrombocytosis and erythrocytosis in infected mice. Clonogenic progenitor cell assays of cells from
the bone marrow and spleens of these Infected mice suggest that EPO-R(R129C) can stimulate proliferation
‘of committed megakaryocytic and erythroid progenitors as well as nonerythroid multipotent progenitors. From
the spleens of SFFVCEPO-R-infected mice, eight multiphenotypic immortal cell lines were isolated at
characterized, These included primitive erythroid, lymphoid, and monocytic cells. Some expressed prote
‘characteristic of more than one lineage. All cell lines resulting from SFFVcEPO-R infection contained a mutant
form of the p53 gene. However, in contrast to infection by SFFV, activation of PUL gene expression, by
retroviral integration, was not observed. One cell line bad integrated a provirus upstream of the fi-? gene, in
1 location typically seen in erythroleukemic cells generated by Friend murine leukemia virus infection. This
event led to increased expression of fi-I in this cell line. Thus, infection by SFFVcEPO-R can induce
proliferation and lead to transformation of nonerythroid as well as very immature erythroid progenitor eels.

Hematopoietic cell proliferation and diferentiation are
large part controlled by several growth factors that transduce
proliferation andior differentiation signals through specific cell
Surface receptors (38). The majority of hematopoictic growth
factors utlze receptors that are members of the etokine oF
hhematopoietin receptor superfamily, including receptors for
cexythropoietin (EPO), granuloeyte-macrophage (GM) colony-
stimulating factor, granulocyte-stimolatory factor, and inter
leukin2 (IL-2), 1.3, IL-4, IL, IL-4, and IL7 (4, 13). The
tosolic domains of these receptors are dissimilar, and none
contains any known enzymatic activity. These receptors are
‘thought to signal by activating cytosolic enzymes, in particular
‘one or more protein kinases (39). Specifically the EPO recep-
tor (EPO-R) has been shown to complex with and activate the
cytosolic tyrosine kinase JAK2, which is widely expressed in
different hematopoietic progenitor cells (63). Expression of
recombinant EPO-R in normally IL-3-dependent cell lines
allows them to grow in either IL3 or EPO (33, 39). If a
constitutively activated form of the EPO-R, EPO-R(RI29), i
expressed in these same cells, neither IL-3 nor EPO is required
to sustain proliferation (34). These observations suggest that at
least some common intracellular sigals are generated by the
receptors for IL-3 and EPO. However, expression of EPO-
R(R129C) in ftal iver erythroid progenitors can replace the
EPO requirement but not the IL-S or stem cell factor (SCF)
requitement for diferentiation of GM and erythroid burst
forming unit (BFU-E) progenitors (51). Thus, we do not know
the foll extent to which signals generated by the various
‘ojtokine receptors overlap.

TEPO is thought to act on relatively late, coms

‘throid precursor cells in adult bone marrow or fetal liver (55).
However, an EPO-R is expressed on megakaryocytes, and
[EPO may affect proliferation and/or diferentation of these
‘alls (10,15) Also, the EPO-R gene is expressed in embryonic
stem calls and some of their diffcrentisted hemetopoietc
‘progeny, as well as in a number of cel lines arrested at
different stages of hematopoietic development, and thus EPO
ray affect proliferation and/or differentiation of multiple types
‘of eels 21,25).

Leukemia can be regarded as a multistage disease process,
involving multiple genetic abnormalities affecting <ifering
pathways controling cell proliferation andior diferentiation
(62). Because the celular hallmarks of leukemia are dysrego-
lated proliferation and differentiation, the role of growth
factors and their receptors in the leukemic process has been
the focus of a great deal of investigation. Constitutive (ys
regulated) overexpression of hematopoietic growth factors
(EPO, GM colony-stimulatng factor, and IL-3) in mice results
in mycloprolferaive disorders, not leukemia (12, 4, 27, 57).
(On the other hand, activating mutations in some hematopot-
tic growth factor receptors (colony-stimulating factor 1 recep-
tor (CSF-1R}, EPO-R) have, in experimental murine models,
Jed tothe development of leukemia in a multistep process (20,
34). Specifically, the EPO-R has been implicated in two modes
‘of leukemia induction.

Friend virus is an acutely transforming murine erythroleu-
emia retrovirus. A replication-defective spleen focus-forming
virus (SFFV) and a replication-competent Friend murine
leukemia virus (F-MULV) comprise the Friend virus complex.
F-MuLY induces leukemias of multiple phenotypes but only
when injected into newborn mice and after a long latency
period. SFFV induces only enthroleukemia in both newbora
and adult mice. The env gene of SFFV encodes a recombinant)
