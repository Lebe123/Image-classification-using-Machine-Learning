Cigarette Smoke Formation Studies
V. The Effects of the Cigarette Periphery on Mainstream Smoke Formation”

INTRODUCTION

In a recent report, recommendations for the seandard-
ied preparation of carbon-14 labelled cigarettes were
made (1). Ie was shown that the error generated in
uniformly placing the radiosctive label axially with
the rod is also the degree of error reflected in the radio-
activity recovered from total smoke. Cigarees with large
variations in the axial placement of the label would
equite che smoking of a large mumber of such cigarertes,
to determine the toral smoke distribution. The data thus
generated are reflective of the average values, but with
a large experimental error. The more usiformly labelled
‘he cigareree the smaller the error in the total smoke
distribution.

When the_radioactivity ie not uniformly distributed
radially within the cigacene, the smoking of a large
‘umber of ‘cigarettes might not overcome any bias
imparted to the data. Egerton (2), Keith (3), Wakeham
(A) and Osdene (5) have all theorized about the effects
of the periphery on mainseream smoke formation. To
date, thee is very litle experimental evidence to si
Pore these hypotheses. In order to empitically ascerain
the importance of the tobacco periphery to smoke for-
‘ation, carbon-{4 labelled cigareres have been prepared
‘ith uniform and non-uniform radial labelling. Effecs
‘of radial positioning on the total smoke distributions
‘were measured,

 

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Preparation of Labelled Cigarettes

‘The cabon-i4 labelled cigarertes were fabricated by
the procedures recommended for the standardized pee-
aration of labelled cigareres (1). The cigaretes were
Prepared by three basi incorporation methods:
1. Syringe-Spiking: This procedure was used to add the
labelled compounds primarily to the central portion ‘of
the cigarere sod (1).
2. Spraying: This procedure was employed: when solu
lity permiteed, and produced cigarette filler uniformly
labelled with the carboo-14 compounds, Cigarettes were
then handmade at previously deveribed (1)

3, Sheetcasting-Blending: This procedure was used when
materials were insoluble in desired solvents. The labelled
sheet materials were then either uniformly blended into
‘normal University of Kenmucky 1R1 reference fller or
‘were added at discrete radial postions within the ciga-
seus od (1).

Radiodbemicale

Dottiacontane-16,17-4C was purchased from Male
lindkrodt Nuclear and proline-4C (U) from New Eng
land Nuclear. Nicotine-HC (U) and cellalose-"C ()
‘were obtained from bioeynthesized Brighe tobaccoMC
(©) (6) Invere sugar (U) war prepared by the weat-
iment of glucose-HC (U) (New England Neclear) with
invertase. Radiochemical purities in all cases were beer
than 98% before application.

Radioactivity Determinations

‘Appropriate liquots of the extracted or combusted
samples were counted in a Packard Model 3390 scintle
lation spectrometer (Packard Instrument Company) with
‘optimized gain and window settings. The procedures
and cockuils wed have been previously described (7).

Cigarette Smoking

‘The procedures and smoking machine instrumentation
‘were deseribed previously (7) and were used to obti
the MC-activity distributions in che total cigarette smoke

 

 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Keith (9), Wakeham (4) and Osdene (5) have each
theorized about the effees of the tobacco cigarette peri-
phery on mainstream smoke formation, They reasoned
that the major pathway of air into che cigarete during
piling is berween the jonction of the paper and che
coal, referred to by Wakeham as the “bypass zone"
(Figure 1). The low aie permeability of the paper and
the high resistance of the coal combine to bring about
4 preferential passage of air chrough the bypass zone.
‘The cigarese daring puffing would burn the tobacco
more rapidly around the periphery than in the center.
Hence, the periphery should play 2 larger proporcionace
role in mainstream smoke formation than the center see
