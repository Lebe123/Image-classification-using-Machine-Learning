ORTICOSTEROIDS have been shown to affect the activity of a number of

‘enzymatic reactions involving molecular oxygen."*# Some of these enzmes
produce superoxide anion, 2 potentially harmful substance which has been im;
cated in the deleterious eifects of oxygen upon the lung.* Among the enzymes of
this group is aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH)*** a eytochrome P-4S0
(P-448)-related enzyme,” Cytochrome P-450 hydroxylations are known to produce
superoxide anion and to be influenced by steroid hormones.” It appeared of
interest, therefore, to investigate the effect of adrenalectomy and corticosteroids
upon this drug-metabolizing enzymatic system in the lung and to attempt to relate
it to the production of superoxide anion.
