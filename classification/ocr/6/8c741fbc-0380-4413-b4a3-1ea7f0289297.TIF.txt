Background. The hereditary fat adenoma syndrome
(HFAS) is characterized by an autosomal dominantly in-
herited predisposition to multiple colonic adenomas
(usually less than 100) with proximal predominance and
flat as opposed to polypoid growth. Patints with the syn-

perience colorectal cancers in excess, and the

distributed randomly inthe colon. The ese

later age (median, 85 years) compared with ago
at onset of eater inpatients with familial adenomatous
polyposis (FAP) and patients with the Lynch syndromes.
FAP and BFAS are linked to the same locus on chromo-
some q21-q22.

     

 

‘Methods. Upper endoscopic examination was per-
formed on 22 relatives from four families with HFAS.

‘Results. Fifteen patients from three of these families
had multiple fundic gland polyps; four had duodenal or
‘gastric adenomas. Periampullary carcinoma was present
{in two members from separate families.

milial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), wich is linked to
the APC locus on chromosome 5q21-q22,* The gene
responsible for the disorder was identified recently **
FAP accounts for less than 1% of the total CRC burden.
Multiple gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps and ju-
venile polyps characterize the more rarely occurring
Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and familial juvenile polypo-
sis, respectively." In contrast, the hereditary nonpolyp-

osis CRC syndromes (or Lynch syndromes {and 1) do
not feature multiple colonic polyps. Hereditary nonpol-
yposis CRC syndromes account for approximately
46% of the total CRC burden."

Anew CRC-prone disorder, the hereditary lat ade-
noma syndrome (HFAS), has been described recently.
‘This autosomal dominantly inherited syndrome is char-
acterized by a predisposition to multiple colonic ade-
‘nomas (usually less than 100), with proximal predomi
nance and fat rather than polypoid growth.“ The
‘CRC in this disorder are distributed randomly in the
colon and have a later age of onset (~ 55 years) than
that associated with FAP and the Lynch syndromes.
FAS is similar to FAP in that both syndromes feature
colonic adenomas, have a high lifetime risk for CRC,
and are linked to the same chromosome, 59.* HFAS
differs from FAP in thatthe colonic adenomas in HFAS
are significantly fewer in number and are found in the
proximal colon. Most of the adenomas in HFAS have
the distinctive
