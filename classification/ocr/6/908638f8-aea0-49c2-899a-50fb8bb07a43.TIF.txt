Toxicity of Aerosols

Introduction

[x recent seams there has been a growing
concern about the toxicity of aerosol
products that are sold for medicinal, per-
sonal, or houschold use. The most serious
ineidents have been death from the in-
halation of acrosol for household use that
is collected in a plastic bag, @ dangerous
practice which clearly constitutes a mis-
use of the product, There is no question
that the fatal outcome of this habit is re-
lated to the inhalation of acrosol propel-
ants that are known to be toxic to the
cardiovascular and respiratory systems.
The potential hazards of aerosols con-
taining bronchodilator drugs are diffieult
to assess. ‘The therapeutic value of the
rug can readily be measured, but the
toxicity of the propellants is uncertain,
‘The available information indicates that
in animals the inhalation of high eon-
centrations of propellants may eause fatal
ceardiae arrhythmias, ‘The animals used in
these studies do not suffer from broncho-
spasm, so that there is a possibility that
the presenee of bronchopulmonary dis-
case might inerease the sensitivity of the
heart to lower concentrations of the pro-
pellants. Deaths have been reported in
ceases of asthma associated with the use of
aerosol bronchodilators. Unfortunately,
a retrospective examination has failed

to either implicate or exclude the rele
fof propellants in contributing to the
fatalities.

‘The aerosol products intended to

 

  

humidify and medieate the room are not
introduced directly into the respiratory
passages. The concentration of the pro-
pellant that is inhaled is lower than that
‘of bronchodilators, because of its dilution
by mixture with room air. However, one
aerosol product for medication of the
room was reported to have caused 21
deaths, and it has been withdrawn from
the market, presumably because of the
toxicity of the propellant.

‘The remaining group of aerosols for
personal use, consisting of hairsprays,
Acodorants, and feminine hygiene prod-
ets, present a different form of hazard.
‘These are not introduced directly into
the air passages but are sprayed on vari-
ous parts of the body. The propellants
generated from the acrosols for personal
use are inhaled at a lower concentra
than the other acrosol produets. How.
ever, the personal produets are used more
frequently than the others There is no
adequate information on the toxicity aris-

1g from chronic use of these propellants,
This article is intended to review the
present state of knowledge on the toxicity
of acrosol products. An attempt will be
made to distinguish the effects of the pro-
pellants from those of the therapeatie
agent contained in the acrasol.
