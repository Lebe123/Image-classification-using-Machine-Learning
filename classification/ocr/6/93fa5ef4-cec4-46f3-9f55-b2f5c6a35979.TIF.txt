ULTRASTRUCTURAL FEATURES OF PAPILLOMATOSIS
AND CARCINOMA OF NIPPLE DUCTS

The Significance of Myoepithelial Cells and Basal Lamina
in Benign, “Questionable,” and Malignant Lesions®

VICTOR E. GOULD
AND RALPH W. SNYDER

 

The last few years have witnessed an increasing interest in the earliest possible
means of diagnosing breast cancer. Refinements in clinical methods such as mam-
‘mography and other techniques as well as growing public awareness of the problem
have contributed to this upsurge. Conventional lightmicroscopy and histochemistry
are unlikely to yield the “final” answer to early diagnonis since

the neoplastic process are presumably biochemical. Ultrastruct
Produced many interesting findings but their clinical application has not been
learly established. Thus, careful histologic examination remains to date the
‘comerstone for the diagnosis of breast cancer. Inevitably, a8 one ventures into the
field of “early” or “incipient” neoplasia, controversy is bound to atise for seemingly
subjective judgments and opinions are likely ingredients in the development of
newer diagostic criteria." *#

Subareolar duct papillomatonis (syn. florid papillomatonis of nipple ducts,
adenoma of the nipple, et.) constitutes one of the most unusual breast lesions and
fone in which an erroneous pathologic interpretation may lead to unwarranted
radical therapy. Clinically, che lesion often presents with nipple crusting and oozing
thus mimicking Paget's disease. Morphologically its florid and often disturbing
pattern is at odds with its generally benign clinical behavior. The tumor may also
display a focally sclerotic pattern remi of adenosi
