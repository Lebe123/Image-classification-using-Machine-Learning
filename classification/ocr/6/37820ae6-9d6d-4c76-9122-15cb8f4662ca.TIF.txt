Abstract

[A twofold change in the cisplatin (DDP) sensitivity of 2008
hhuman ovarian carcinoma cells is sufficient to reduce tumor
response in vivo. The DDP sensitivity of these cells can be
enhanced by activation of the epidermal growth factor and pro-
‘ein kinase C signal transduction pathways. We report here
that two endogenous growth factors, bombesin and tumor ne-
crosis factor alpha (TNFa), enhanced DDP sensitivity by fac-
tors of 1.70.1 (SD)-fold and 1.80.1 (SD)-fold, respectively.
Both agents also produced sensitization in an 11-fold DDP-re-
sistant 2008 subline, Neither bombesin nor TNFa changed the
accumulation of DDP, glutathione content, or glutathione-S-
transferase activity in 2008 cells. However, a 2-h exposure to
‘oth bombesin and TNFa was suficent to increase 2008 clon-
ing efficiency by up to 2.60.1 (SD)-fold and 2.220.1 (SD)-
fold, and it increased average colony size by 1.3520.1 (SD)-
fold and 1.55+0.1 (SD)-fol, respectively. Bombesin increased
intracellular free calcium, and this was blocked by the bombe-
sin receptor-specific antagonist SC196, demonstrating that
2008 cells have functional bombesin receptors. These results
indicate that bombesin and TNFa can enhance sensitivity to
DDP in both DDP sensitive and resistant variants of a human
‘ovarian carcinoma and that both agents serve as growth factors
for this tumor. (J. Clin, Invest, 1992. 90:1436-1442,) Key

decapeptide originally isolated from frog skin (2), has been
shown to act as a mitogen for Swiss 373 fibroblasts (3) and J
Ihuman small cell lung carcinomas (4). This peptie also has

potent pharmacological effects on pancreatic cells (5) and
Clicts the release of other peptide hormones such 2s insulin |
‘Since the administration ofthis hormone stimulates the release

of other peptides, itis difficult to obtain evidence fora direct
biological activity of bombesin. In Swiss 373 cells, high affinity
receptors specific for this peptide have been demonstrated (6),
and bombesin is able to directly activate PKC (7). Thereisalso
indirect evidence that bombesin can activate PKC in human
tumor cells based on its ability to generate inositol triphos-
phates and increase intracellular free calcium {(Ca*}}(5, 8).

‘Tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa), secreted by macro-
phages (9), isa cytokine with a wide range of regulatory actions
‘on immune responses, inflammation, cell growth, and differ |
‘entiation (10). TNFa has been reported to enhance the cyto-
toxicity of cis-diamminedichloro-platinura(I1) (DDP) in vitro
toa human stomach adenocarcinoma (11) and a human ovar-
jan carcinoma cell line (12). In contrast, TNFa: does not dem-
“onstrate en actual synergistic effect when combined with DDP
in a human bladder transitional cal carcinoma in vivo (13).
Furthermore, when TNFa was administered for the treatment
of intraperitoneal ovarian cancer xenografts, although it pro
longed survival in tumor-bearing mice (10), it also promoted
‘the establishment of multiple subperitoneal tumors. Like 12-
(O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), TNFa activates
PKCin some cell types and thisin turn may result in increased
[AP-| activity and induction of AP-1-responsive genes (14).
‘This is considered to be a key mechanism mediating at least
some ofthe biological effects of TNFa mentioned above.

‘We have previously reported that TPA activation of PKC
increased DDP sensitivity by a factor of 2.5-fold in human
ovarian carcinoma 2008 cells (15). Likewise, epidermal
growth factor (EGF), another potent activator of PKC, en
hhances DDP sensitivity by 3.1-f0ld in the same cel line (16).
We report here that bombesin and TNFa, two endogenous
ligands whose receptors have the potential of activating PKC,
are also potent modulators of DDP sensitivity in 2008 cells
‘and, moreover, are both mitogenic for this tumor.
