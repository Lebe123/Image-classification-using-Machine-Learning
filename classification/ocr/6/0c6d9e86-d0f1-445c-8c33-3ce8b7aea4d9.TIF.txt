INTRODUCTION
It has been demonstrated that degradation of double-stranded DNA occurs in the

Presence of Cu(II) ions, 1,10-phenanthroline (OP), 8 reducing agent and 02 (1-2).
The copper complex of 5-NO3-0P was found to be more effective than OP in cleav=
ing DNA, white that of 2,2-bipyridy] (bipy) did not degrade NA under the same
conditions (1-3)." The mechanism of the cleavage reaction was assumed to be
through a site specific mechanism where the bound Cu(1) complex to DNA is oxi-
dized by H,0, to form the OH" radical at the binding site. This mechanism ex-
Plains the toxicity of the OH" formed as it is formed at the binding site and

can hardly be scavenged.

Discussion
The reaction scheme for bound and free copper complexes (CuL3*, Cul},

Cut3) include the following steps:

 

puascuts*, oN

 

  

cuL§*or onazcurg* + 05 —+ cuts or pnazcutg + 0, a
Cutg or DNAzCUL3 + 1,0, —» cuL3* or oNAzCuLZ* + OH” + On @
DNA or DNA=CuL3* + OH" —+ damage «@)

In addition the reoxidation of Cu(I1) by oD can occur:
4)

+ cut + on + 2H* 2s ary
CuLZ or DNASCUL} + 03 + 2H” —~ cuLZ* or vnazcuLs* + HZ02
If we analyze the sequence of these reactions we find that reactions (1) and (2)
describe the catalysis of the Haber-Weiss reaction which yields the deleterious

OH", while reactions (1) and (4) describe the catalysis of the dismutation of 03

and hence prevent the formation of OH". Thus a copper compound can serve either

as a catalyst of the Haber-Weiss reaction or as a catalyst of the dismutation of

03. It turns out that whether the copper compound catalyzes the dismutation of
03 or catalyzes the Haber-Weiss reaction depends on the competition between re-
actions (2) and (4), It has been shown that k4/kz > 10° for the various free
copper complexes (4) and since in most biological systems [H202}/103}< 109 (5),
the dismutation of 03 predominates and we do not expect any appreciable produc-
tion of OH" through the Haber-wWeiss reaction and no toxicity is expected (6).
The question is how is 03 toxic in the presence of these copper complexes? We
