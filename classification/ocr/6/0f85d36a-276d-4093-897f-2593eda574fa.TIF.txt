Tobacco’s toll

smoking is factor, and an important factor, in
the production of carcinoma of the hung.” In those
words, causously and with no talk of calculating the
global burden of tobacco, Doll and Hill put the case
for causation before a largely unsuspecting world.
“That was over forty years ago, preceding the study i
Bridsh doctors with which’ the lung cancer and
smoking connection is usually associated. We now
know that cancer of the lung is not the whole story: for
every tobacco-associated death from that cause there
are wo or thee from other diseases. That has made a
bad situation worse. So, predictably, has the increase
(of lung cancer in women, who came to the smoking
hhabie later than men. Noc all is gloom, however,
‘Smoking is on the decrease in the United States and.
(Canada and, more tentatively, in parts of Europe, and.
the benefits in terms of certain health indices are
already discemible. Stopping smoking helps: unless a
tumour or other severe cardiorespiratory lesion has
already developed, it is noc too late, Furthermore,
there is now suificleat confidence in the associations
for estimations to be made, for public health and
‘health education purposes, of the mortality burden of
smoking; and organisations such as the US Surgeon-
General's office and the UK's Health Education,
Authority have already done this, In October, 1989,
the World Health Organisation convened @
consultative group on tobacco-related mortality. The
calculations presented in detail this week (p 1268) are
the outcome of a process that began then and
continued with presentations at the 7th World
Conference on Tobacco and Health and in WHO's
Tobacco Alert in Jeouary, 1991?

“Obviously crude” isnoca label normally stuckona
set of calculations by Peto and colleagues, but the
information for totally confident arithmede is not
available. They have had to make assumptions but
have exercised them conservatively, and the few
‘estimates that have been reached by other routes 0
seem to Gin with the figures presenced this week. As
Peto and co-workers note, these are approximations
despite their apparenc precision—but one could lop 2
zero off some of them and still be impressed, Pezoet al
