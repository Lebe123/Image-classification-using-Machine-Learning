‘Nicotine, the presumed active pharmacological agent in tobacco, produces variable effects
fon behavior that are at best described as “‘paradoxical"” in nature, Thus, nicotine, via
tobacco use in humans or nicotine administration in experimental animals, tends to trans-
pose behavior depending on predrug baseline rates of behavior. High rates of behavior
appear to be reduced, while low rates of behavior appear to be increased by nicotine.
This work further proposes that nicotine’s variable effects on behavior may be related
to its capacity to act as a behavioral agonist and/or antagonist via its ability either to
activate or to desensitize distinct central nicotinic acetyleholinergic receptors (nACHR's).
‘Nicotine is portrayed as a neuronal modulating agent that can affect behavior contingent
uupon the genetic makeup of the individual subject being studied. Depending on the
structure, function, and location of distinct mAChR’s, nicotine appears to be able to induce
1 wide range of behavioral effects important to the tobacco user. However, this does not
rule out the role the importance that other biogenic amine systems (j.e., serotonin or
dopamine) may have in the genetics of tobacco use or nicotine’s variable effects on
behavior.

INTRODUCTION

The use of nicotine via its presence in tobacco has
been both engaging and enigmatic to many re-
searchers over the last 30 years. Its behavioral ef-
fects in man appear to be “paradoxical” in nature
(Robinson and Pritchard, 1992), i.e., some individ-
uals appear to be aroused by nicotine (via smoking)
while others are sedated following similar dosing
patterns. Tobacco use has also had an important
societal funetion in Native American and West In-
dian cultures and has served man well in times of
crisis (Klein, 1993). As pointed out by Klein,
“‘General Pershing once wrote that they (cigarettes)

were as vital to his troops as food.”” Even Shamans
in South America have employed tobacco use for
centuries as a means of warding off the evil spirits *
believed to cause disease in these tribal societies
(Wilbert, 1987). Thus, nicotine has a rich phar-
macological history of use in man, at least via the
use of tobacco.

Nicotine’s “paradoxical” nature has also been
observed at the molecular level in studies evaluat-
ing its effects at the nicotinic acetylcholinergic re-
‘ceptor (nACHR’s). Marks ef al. (1985), for exam-
ple, were the first to note that chronic nicotine
administration was capable of inducing an up-reg-
ulation (increase in the number of receptors) of
central nACBR’s. The molecular mechanism of,
RACHR up-regulation appears to be related to ni-
