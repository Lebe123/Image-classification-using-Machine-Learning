An Automated Steam Distillation-Ultra Violet
Absorption Method for the Determination of
Nicotine Alkaloids in Tobacco and Smoke

‘An automated procedure for the determination of
nicotine alkaloids in tobacco and smoke is most
desirable for a laboratory concerned with the rou-
tine analysis of commercial tobaccos and cigarettes.

‘The official, non-automated AOAC method (1),
which is used in most laboratories concerned with
the analysis of tobacco products, is precise and ac-
curate; it mcorporates a steam distillation process
to isolate the nicotine alkaloids followed by an ul-
traviolet spectrophotometric assay. Automated
methods (2, 3) have been developed for the deter-
tion of nicotine alkaloids in tobacco, but these
Ail javolve a colorimetric assay based on the react-

jon of nicotine with cyanogen bromide and this co
Tour reaction is not as sensitive as the ultra-violet
absorption measurement. In addition, in these pu
Diished methods (3) the analyses are made on an
aqucous extract of tobacco, without the preliminary
steam distillation whichallows the nicotine alkaloids
to_be isolated and freed from mostof the interfering
substances. Whilst the steam distillation stage is not
essential for some tobaccos, itis needed with to-
bbaceos of low sugars contents and with all smoke
solutions. It appeared worthwhile therefore, to de-
velop an automated method, which is generally app-
Ticable to both smoke and tobacco; such a method
should incorporate a steam distillation to isolate the
nicotine alkaloids, followed by an ultra-violet spec-
trophotometric measurement.

 

 

Apparatus

A standard Technicon Sampler II and Proport-
foning Pump are used. These are linked to a spe-
cially designed steam distilation unit and to a
Beckman DB spectrophotometer equipped with
Alow-through cells which were also specially desig
ned,

‘Steam Disilation Unit

‘The steam distillation unit consists of three main
sections (Figure 1):—

 

(1) a preheater;
@) a heating unit;
) a distilation unit.
‘The preheater isa straight length of glass tubing,
2 ft in length and 3/16 in (48 mm) O.D., and
is connected to the heating unit by a glass U piece.
The heating unit consists of a straight length of
lass tubing 2 ft in length and 3/16 in. O.D., tightly

 

 

The windings are interwound with asbestos paj
and covered with two layers of woven asbestos tape
to provide thermal insulation. Both the preheater
and heating unit are mounted between asbestos end
plates and enclosed in a metal jacket, (4 in.x4 in.
cross-section), lined with asbestos. Power to the
hheating unit is supplied via a Variac, set to give
