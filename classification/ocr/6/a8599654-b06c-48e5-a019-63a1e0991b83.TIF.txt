Human p*thalassemic -plobin genes harboring either a frameshift or « avasense mutation that results in
the premature termination of B-globia mRNA translation have been previously intraduced into the germ line
of mice (SK. Lim, J. J. Mullins, C-M. Chea, K. Gross, and L. E. Maguat, EMBO J. 82613-2619, 1989).
Each transgene produces properly processed albeit abnormally unstable mRNA as well as several smaller
RNAs in erythroid cells. These smaller RNAS are detected only in the cytoplasm and, relative to mRNA, are
Tonger-lived and are missing sequences from either exon Tor exons [and LL, La this communication, we show
by using genetics and SI nuclease transcript mapping that the prematurs termination of fizlobin mRNA
translation is mechanistically required for the abnormal RNA metabolism. We also provide evidence that
‘generation of the smaller RNAS isa cytoplasmic process: the 5” ends of intron L-contaiing pre-mRNAs were
formal, the rates of removal of introns 1 and 2 were normal, and studies inhibiting RNA synthesis with
fctinomycin D demonstrated  precursor-product relationship between full-length mRNA and the smaller
RNAs. In vivo, about 50% of the full-length species that undergo decay ave degraded tothe smaller RNAS and
the rest are degraded to undetectable products. Exposure of erythroid cells that expressed a normal human
‘Bealobin transgene to either cycloheximide or puromycin did not result in the zeneration of the smaller RNAS.
‘Therefore, a drug-induced reduction in cellular protein synthesis does not produce this aspect of cytoplasmic
‘mRNA metabolism, These data suggest that the premature termination of -iobia mRNA translation in either
‘exon Tor exon Il results in the ytoplasmic generation of discrete mRNA degradation products that are missing

mRNA exists to be translated into protein. However,
evidence suggests that in the process of being traasiated, the
fabundance of an mRNA can be altered. For some mRNAs,
abundance is increased ifthe coding region isnot translated
fn full, Examples of this type include mRNAS for the
replication-dependent human histones (10, 18, 26); human
fas (19, 41, 42}; murine comyc (50); yeust MATal (35); and
hamster, chicken, murine, and sea urchin B-tubulin (16, 17,
534, 51, 52) In each case, translation to atleast u certain point
‘within the coding region of the mRNA appears to be required
for mRNA degradation, and nonsense codons that reside
upstream of that point are associated with an increase in
mRNA abundance. While similar in this regard, however,
each of these mRNAS is not degraded as a function of the
Same features of translation. Histone mRNA degradation at
the end of S phase requires that ribosomes translate to within
‘a specific distance of a hairpin structure that resides in the 3
untranslated region. In contrast, cfos, c-myc, and MATal
mRNA degradation seems to require ribosome translation
across @ specific region of the coding sequence. And, as
another variation, B-lubulin mRNA decay depends upon an
texoess of free tubulin that presumably interacts with the frst,
‘Famino acids of an actively elongating, nascent peptide,

For mRNAs of another type, the presence of nonsense
‘codons is associated with a decrease in mRNA abundance.
Examples of this type include mRNAs for human f-globin
