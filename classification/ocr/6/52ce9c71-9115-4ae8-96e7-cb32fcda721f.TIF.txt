Abstract. radiation with long-wave UV light (LUV) at
366 nm of cells that had been incubated with 12-(\-py-
rene)dodecanoic acid (P12), a fatty acid derivative with
covalently linked pyrene nucleus, resulted in cytotoxicity
Using the in vitro established human cell ines HL-60 and
1U-937, we demonstrated that these leukemic cells are much
more susceptible to the photosensitizing effect of PI than
normal bone marrow (BM); a 4-log reduction in the number
of clonogenic leukemic cells was achieved under conditions
‘where colony formation by normal hemopoietic progenitors
was reduced by <40%, Moreover, the results of irradiating
‘mixed populations of leukemic and normal cells indicated
that phototoxicity of leukemic cells was not affected by the
presence of a large excess of normal BM cells, nor was the
survival of normal BM cells influenced by the presence of
leukemic cells. These findings suggested that the procedure
‘could be adapted for selective ex vivo elimination of malig-
nantcells,i.¢,,purging of BM in remission prior to autologous
transplantation.

Methods for purging neoplastic cells from harvested marrow
are being developed to increase the efficacy of autologous
‘bone marrow (BM) transplantation (1-3). One approach is
selective photosensitization, using sensitizing compounds and
fight radiation (4, 5]. The variety of compounds shown to
exert @ photosensitizing effect includes the hematoporphy-
‘ins, phuthlocyanines, and meroeyanines [6-8]. These well-
studied fluorescent compounds are taken up preferentially
by tumor ceils and undergo photoexcitation when exposed
toappropriate nonionizing radiation. We have recently shown,
that 12-(L-pyreneytodecanoie acid (P12), fatty acd to which
1 pyrene ring has becn covalently linked, isan eficent and
selective photosensitizing agent [9]. Among the various py-
rene-containing fatty acids studied, P12 was most effectively
transported across the cell membrane and subsequently in-
‘corporated into the cell's neutral-and phospholipids (10, 11}.
Celis of different types and stages of maturation were found
to vary in their rate of P12 uptake and incorporation {12]
Incubation of cells with P12, followed by irradiation with
long-wave UV light (LUV) at 366 nm resulted in cellular

toxicity, which was related to the intensity of irradiation as
‘well as fo the rateand extent of P12 uptake [9 13]. The latter
could be influenced by modifying the incubation conditions,
such as P12 concentration, addition of serum albumin, in-
clusion of ronfluorescent fatty acids, or changing the tem-
perature (1). Consequently, all these parameters also af-
fected pho:osensitization of the cells. The procedure proved
tobe efficient in selectively eliminating certain cell types and
sparing other, more cesistant cells [9], The higher sensitivity
of some undifferentiated leukemic cells, as compared with
theiedifercatiated nomleukemic progeny, suggested that this
procedure might be utilized for selective elimination af ms
lignant cells trom bone marrow prior to autologous trans
plaatation

In the prosent study, we tested the potential usefulness of
P12 as a pursing agent using human leukemic cell ines and
normal bone marrow cells as model systems. The results
demonstcated 2 preferential phototoxicity against leukemic
cells under conditions in which normal hemopoietic progen-
iors were preserved.
