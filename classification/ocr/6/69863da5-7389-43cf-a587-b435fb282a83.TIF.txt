Clathrin and its associated proteins constitute a major class of coat proteins involved in
vesicle budding during membrane transport. An interesting characteristic of the yeast
clathrin heavy chain gene (CHC) is that in some strains a CHI deletion is lethal, while
in others it is not. Recently, our laboratory developed a screen that identified five
multicopy suppressors that can rescue lethal stains of clathrin heavy chain-defcient
yeast (Chc™ scd1-i) to viability. One of these suppressors, SCDS, encodes a novel protein
of 872 amino acids containing two regions of repeated motifs of unknown function.
Deletion of SCDS has shown that it is essential for cell growth at 30°C. scd5-A strains
carrying low copy plasmids encoding C-terminal truncations of Scd5p are temperature
sensitive for growth at 37°C. At the nonpermissive temperature, cells expressing a
338-amino acid deletion (Scd5p-4338) accumulate an internal pool of fully glycosylated
invertase and mature a-factor, while processing and sorting of the vacuolar hydrolase
carboxypeptidase Y is normal. The truncation mutant also accumulates 80- to 100-nm.
vesicles similar to many late sec mutants. Moreover, at 34°C, overexpression of Scd5p
suppresses the temperature sensitivity of a sec2 mutant, which is blocked at a post-Golgi
step of the secretory pathway. Biochemical analyses indicate that ~50% of ScdSp sedi-
ments with a 100,000 x g membrane fraction and is associated as a peripheral membrane
protein. Overall, these results indicate that ScdSp is involved in vesicular transport at a
late stage of the secretory pathway. Furthermore, this suggests that the lethality of
clathrin-deficient yeast can be rescued by modulation of vesicular transport at this late
secretory step. °

 

INTRODUCTION

The transfer of proteins along the secretory and endo-
ytic pathways occurs by vesicular transport. The for-
mation of transport vesicles involves the recruitment
of coat proteins to the cytoplasmic face of the mem-
brane to facilitate budding. In addition, such coat pro-
teins can mediate the selection of vesicle cargo. A
number of different types of coated vesicles have
been characterized including clathrin-coated vesi-
cles (Pearse and Robinson, 1990), COP-coated vesi-
cles (Rothman and Orci, 1992), and COPII-coated
vesicles (Barlowe et al, 1994). Clathrin and its asso-
ciated proteins play a key role in the selective con-

centration and sorting of proteins during receptor-
mediated endocytosis (for reviews, see Brodsky,
1988; Pearse and Robinson, 1990). In addition, they
are involved in sorting of lysosomal hydrolases via
mannose-6-phosphate receptors from the trans-Golgi
network to a pre-lysosomal compartment (Campbell
and Rome, 1983; Brown and Farquhar, 1984) and they
are involved in the formation of secretion granules,
eg. in hormone or neuropeptide-secreting cells (Tooze
and Tooze, 1986; Burgess and Kelly, 1987).

Although most early information on clathrin coat
protein structure and function was derived from bio-
chemical and cytological studies using animal cells in
the last several years yeast has provided genetic ap-
proaches to the study of the clathrin-mediated vesic-
ular transport machinery. The yeast clathrin heavy
