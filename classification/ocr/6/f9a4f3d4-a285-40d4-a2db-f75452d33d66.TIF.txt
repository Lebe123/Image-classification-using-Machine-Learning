Abstract—Meta-analysis, a set of statistical tools for combining and integrating the
results of independent studies of a given scientific issue, can be useful when the stringent
conditions under which such integration is valid are met. In this report we point out
the dificuties in obtaining sound meta-analyses of either controlled clinical trials or
epidemiological studies. We demonstrate that hastily or improperly designed meta-
‘analyses can lead to results that may not be scientifically valid. We note that much care
is typically taken when meta-analysis is applied to the results of clinileal trials. The Food
and Drug Administration, for example, requires strict adherence to the principles we
discuss in this paper before it allows a drug's sponsor to use a meta-analysis of separate
clinical studies in support of a New Drug Application.

‘Such care does not always carry over to epidemiological studies, as demonstrated by
the 1986 report of the National Research Council concerning the purported association
between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and the risk of tung cancer. On the
basis of a meta-analysis of 13 studies, 10 of which were retrospective and the remaining
3 prospective in nature, the Council concluded that non-smokers who are exposed to
fenviconmental tobacco smoke are at greater risk of acquiring lung cancer than
rhon-smokers not so exposed. In our opinion. this conclusion in unwarranted given the
poor quality of the studies on which itis based,

answer are now considered.

In applications of meta-analysis to clinical
trials, the following questions, among many

other that must be addressed, arise.

‘A working definition of meta-analysis is given
by Huque [I]: “...the term “meta-analysis!
refers to a statistical analysis which combines or
integrates the results of several independent
inical trials, considered by the analyst to be
‘combinable’.” As indicated by this characteriz~

 

@ Are all studies to be included in the meta-
analysis. or only the published ones?

 

 

ation of meta-analysis, its key application is to
be found in the analysis and synthesis of data
from clinical trials.

The question then remains, can meta-analytic
techniques be applied in the analysis of other
kinds of data such as those that arise in cohort
and case-control studies found in epidemiol-
ogy? The answer to this question is a guarded
