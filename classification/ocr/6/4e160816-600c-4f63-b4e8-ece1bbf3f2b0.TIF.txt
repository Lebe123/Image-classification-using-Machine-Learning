Abstract. Small GTPases of the rab family are involved
in the regulation of vesicular transport. Itis believed
that cycling between the GTP- and GDP-bound forms,
‘and accessory factors regulating thi cycling are crucial
for rab function, However, an essential rote for rab mu-
cleotide exchange factors has not yet been demon-
strated, In this report we show the requirement of nu-
cleotide exchange factor activity for Yptl GTPase
‘mediated protein transport. The Yptl protein, a mem-
ber ofthe rab family, plays a role in targeting vesicles to
the acceptor compartment and i essential for the first
two steps ofthe yeast secretory pathway. We use two
YPTT dominant mutations that contain alterations in &
highly conserved GTP-binding domain, N/2/F and
DI2AN. YPTL-DI24N isa novel mutation that encodes
a protein with nucleotide specificity modified from gun-
nine to xanthine. This provides a tool for the study of
an individual rab GTPase in crude extracts: a xan-

thosine triphosphate (XTP)-dependent conditional
dominant mutation, Both mutations confer growth in-
hibition and a block in protein secretion when cx-
pressed in vivo, The purified mutant proteins do not
bind either GDP or GTP. Moreover, they completely
inhibit the ability of the exchange factor to sti
nucleotide exchange for wild type Yptt prote
potent inhibitors of ER to Golgi transport in
the vesicle targeting step. The inhibitory effects of the
‘Yptl-D124N mutant protein on both nucleotide ex-
change activity and protein transport in vitro can be re-
lieved by XTP, indicating that it isthe nucleotide-free
form of the mutant protein that is inhibitory. These re~
sults suggest that the dominant mutant proteins inhibit
protein transport by sequestering the exchange factor
from the wild type Ypt] protein, and that this factor has
an essential role in vesicular transport.

ries of membranous compartments (Palade, 1975).
‘Transport between successive secretory compartments ap-
pears to be mediated by vesicles (Jamieson and Palade,

fever, the mechanisms that regulate the directionality and
specificity ofthese vesicular transport steps are not known,
‘The rab/¥ptl/See4 family of small GTPases has been
shown to play a role in vesicular trafficking (Ferro-Novick
nd Novick, 1993; Zerial and Stenmark, 1993). t hus been
suagested that these proteins act at the different steps of
the secretory pathway to ensure the fidelity of vesicular
targeting (Bourne, 1988; Segev et al., 1988; Lian et al.,
1984; Spgarrd et al, 1994). The ability of rab proteins to
‘eycle between GTP- and GDP-bound forms is believed to
be crucial for their function (Bourne, et al., 1990). The

shift from the GTP- to the GDP-bound form is accom
plished by the endogenous GTPase activity of these pro-
{eins, while the change from the GDP- to the GTP-bound
form is achieved by nucleotide exchange. Most GTP-bind-
ing proteins have slow intrinsic rates of guanine nucleotide
eachange, and thus requite accessory factors to stimulate
the exchange reaction

“The importance of nucleotide exchange for function of
rab-G TPases has been implied in several studies. Fist, rab
proteins thet have a mutation analogous to ras-SI7N,
Which tocks the GTPase in the GDP-bound form, have
been shovn to inhibit protein transport in vivo and in vitro
(Tisdale et al, 1992; Li and Stahl, 1993; Nuoffer et al,
1994; Riederer et a, 1994; Stenmark et al. 1994), Second,
the balk ofthe cytosolic pool of several rab proteins is ap
parently in the GDP-bound state, since itis found in a
Complex with GDP-dissociation inhibitory factor (GDI)!
