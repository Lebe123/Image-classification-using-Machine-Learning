ABSTRACT An enzyme from Saccharomyces cereisoe
‘that cleaves Holliday junctions was partially purified ~S00- (0
1000-fold by DEAE-celllose chromatography, gel ftration on
‘Sephacry1 $300, and chromatography on slag stranded DNA
cellulose. The partaly purified enzyme did not have any
detectable nuclease activity when tested with single-stranded or
double-stranded bacteriophage T7 substrate DNA and did not
have detectable endonuclease activity” when tested with
bacterlophage M13 viral DNA or plasmid pBR322 covalently
closed circular DNA. Analysis ofthe products ofthe cruciform
Cleavage reaction by lerophoreis on peyacrylamie ees
under denaturing conditions revealed thatthe eruelform struc:
ture was cleaved at elther of two sites present in the stem of the
‘eruelform and was not cleaved at the end of the stem, The
‘rucform cleavage enzyme was able to cleave the Hollidsy
Junction present in bacteriophage G4 figure-S molecules.
Eighty percent of these Holliday Junctions were cleaved Inthe
proper orientation to generate intact chromosomes during
enctic recombination.
Ic has been proposed that genetic recorsbinaton ofenin-
volves the formation of an intermediate structure that con-
tains a reciprocal single-stranded crossover between (wo
homologous duplexes, the Holliday junction (1-3). When the
ing genomes are circular, the Holliday intermediate
has a figure-8 configuration. DNA molecules containing
Holliday structures have been observed in recombining
phage and plasmid DNA molecules isolated (com Escherichia
coli and yeast cells and in chromosomal DNA isolated from
yeast 4-10). The enzymology ofthe formation and resolution
of Holliday structures is not well understood, but the RecA.
and Recl proteins, from E. coli and Ustlago maydis,
respectively, probably play a role in the formation of
Holliday junctions in these organisms (11.12), Resolution of
the Holliday junction requires cleavage of the crossed
strands, realignment, and ligation to generate an intact
recombinant duplex. The bacteriophage 17 gene 3 and
bacteriophage 4 gene 49 endonucleases cleave arificialy
constructed Holliday structures (13, 14). Conditionally eth
‘tuations in these genes lead to an ace
branched DNA after infection, suggesting
products may resolve branched recombin
(3, 15-17). Artificial Holliday junctions containing. the
bacteriophage A ait sites within the crossover repion ate
cleaved by the A Int protein (28). The 14 and 7 enzymes.
differ from the Int protein in that they have endonuclease
activity on single-stranded substrates and lack sequence
specificity whereas the Int protein has no single-stranded
DNA-specific endonuclease activity and only cleaves
Halliday junctions constructed from d at sites (14, 18, 19).
We have recently demonstrated that DNA, molecules having

a figure-8 configuration are generated in a Saccharomyces
cerevisiae cell-free recombination system and that these
molecules appear tobe processed during the reaction (20, 21).
Here we deseribe an enzymatic activity from yeast that
cleaves Holliday structures.

 

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Strains. The E.coli strain 1C10287[A(srIR-recA)304, thr-1,
lew, thi, lacYl, galK2, ara-l4, x5, mil-l, proA2, his,
‘argE3, kdgKSI, rpsLil, tsx-33, supB44) used to propagate
plasmids was obtained from A. J. Clark (University of
California, Berkeley), An iaital sample of pBR322::PALI4
DNA @2) was obtained from G, Warren (Advanced Genetic
Sciences, Oakland, CA) and was used to transform E. coli
3C10287 to yield E” coli RDK1S67, A partial restriction map
of this plasmid is presented in Fig. 1. The diploid yeas strain
AP-1 (MATa/MATa, ade1/ADEI, ade2-I/ade2-8, ural/
URAL, his?/HIS7, Wys2/LYS2, irl TYRI, gall /GALI,
CYE2jeyh2, CANi{cant, LEUI/leul) was obtained from
B. Byers (University of Washington, Seattle, WA) (23)

‘Nucleic Acids. Plasmid DNA was'purfied essentially as
described (24). To convert pBR322:PALI14 DNA to the
‘cruciform-containing form, it was incubated at $5°C for 1 hr
in 10 eM Tris IC (pH 8.0)/1 mM EDTA/200 mM NaCl.
‘This treatment converted 60-80% of the molecules to the Hg!
resistant eruciform-containing form (22), To remove the
‘cruciform structure the DNA was heated to 85°C for 5 min in
30 mM Tris HCl (p11 8.0)/1 mM EDTA and quenched on ice.
‘This converted >9%6 of the molecules tothe Bel Il-sensitive
non-cruciform-containing form (22). Bacteriophage T7
PHIDNA (44.6 epm/pmol) was prepared as described (25)
‘17 DNA was denatured by incubating it at 100°C for 10 min
followed by chilling on ice. Bacteriophage Ge figure-8 DNA
