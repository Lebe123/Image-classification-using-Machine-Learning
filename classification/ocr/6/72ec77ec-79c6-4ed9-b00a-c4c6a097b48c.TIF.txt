INTRODUCTION

‘The health effects of diesel exhaust (DE) have been 2 focus of intensive
research during the last decade. Increased use of diesel engines in light-duty
passenger ears and vans stimulated this research, These vehicles are used

‘extensively in populated areas snd thus could increase the exposure of urban
"residents to DE.

Diesel engine-powered vehicles emit moce oxides of nitrogen end some 30
{0 100 times more panicles than do gatoline engines with contemporary
‘emission-control devices. The small size of diesel exhaust particles (DEP)
‘makes them readily respirable, which raises concem for their health effets,
As early as 1955, Ketin etal (1) evalusted the chemical composition of diesel
‘exhaust particle extracts (DEPE) and demonstrated their carcinogenicity in
rmouse-skin-painting studies. However, litle addtional research was done on
DE until the mid-1970s, when advances in biology provided improved
methods such as the Ames Salmonella typhimurium aesay (2) for detecting
mutagenicity and, potentially, careinogeniity. In 1977 the US Environmental
Protection Ageney issued a precautionary notice (3) reporting thet DEPE were
mutagenic in bacterial assays. These findings were subsequently published by
Huisingh et al (4). This observed mutagenicity wiggered a major research
effort on the health effects of DE. The results of this research have been the
topic of several symposia and reviews (5-11), and are briefly reviewed in this
ancl.
