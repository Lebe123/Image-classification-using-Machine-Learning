graph trated that nicotine and
smoking cause an inerease in citechok jon and an increase in free
fatty acids. While these effects of nicotine and tobacco smoke are fairly well
recognized, other points to be considered are: (a) the acute eflects ona nor-
mal cardiovascular systerh with normal coronary arteries; (b) the effect in
patients with heart disease, particularly with coronary arteriosclerosis; and
(e) the cumulative effects of smoking tobseco over a period of many
‘years.

In this report the following will be discussed: (a) clinical features; (b)
the eflect of nicotine and smoking as a stress mechanism; (c) the effect of
nicotine and smoking on corenary blood flow and myocardial oxygen con-
sumption; (d) the effect upon blood lipids

Numerous studies! have been made and nearly all have demonstrated the
statistical association between heavy eigarette smoking and mortality. Death
rates from coronary disease in middle-aged men were found to be 50 to 150
per cent higher among heavy cigarette smokers than among those who did
not smoke. This statisticil association does not prove that heavy cigarette
smoking causes heart disease, but the data strongly suggest that it may con-
tribute to or accelerate the development of coronary disease or its complica:
tions.

‘Thomas et al? compared circulatory patterns uf certain subgroups following.
the smoking of one cigarette. Striking differences were found to be associated
with a family history of hypertension and coronary artery disease. If one or both
parents had hypertension, the subject had an inereased control cardiae output
and cardiac index and showed more than twice as great an increase in
cardiac output and cardiac index alter smoking as subjects with a negative
family history.

Sigler? examined the records of 1520 cases of coronary artery disease and
found that the onset of clisical manifestations of coronary disease occurs at an
