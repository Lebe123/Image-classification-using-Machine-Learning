Abstract. Growth factor over-production by responsive
cells might contribute to their autonomous prolifera-
tion as well as their acquisition of a transformed
phenotype in culture. Basic fibroblast growth factor
(bFGF) has been shown to induce transient changes in
cell behavior that resemble those encountered in trans-
formed cells. In addition, several types of human tu
‘mor cells have been shown to produce BFGF. To de:
termine directly the rote that bFGE might play in the
induction of the transformed phenotype, we have intro
duced a human bFGF eDNA expression vector into

(6). This mitogen appears to be syathesized initially as a
155 residue protein, which ean be further processed through
proteolytic cleavage of its amino-terminal region into two
shorter forms (146 and 131 residues). which are as active as
the native form (Il), BFGF iy structurally related to acidic
fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) (7), and both growth factors
interact with the same cell surface receptors (29). Both
growth factors trigger a similar range of biological effects,
but diftrental activities are apparent. For example, DEGF
induces the proliferation and differentiation of responsive
cells with a much stronger potency (M4). In vivo, us weil as
in vitro, both popides act as potent mitogens and morpho:
ens for a similar wide variety of neuroectodermal and
rmesenchymal-derived cells (4), including vascular endo:
thelial cells (13, 16,17). Recent studies indicate that in vivo,
FGF mimics the effect ofthe vegetalizing factor, which is
responsible in early embryos (Nenopus laevis, tage 8 blastu-
Jae) for the formation of mesenchyme from the animal pole

One of the BHK transfectants, termed clone 19, ex-
presses the DEGF mRNA und produces biologically
active bFGF that accumulates to a high concentration
inside the cells. These properties correlate with the
ability of the cells to grow in serum-free medium
