‘Summary

 

We have developed an automated nonequilibrium procedure for the radio-
Immunoassay of nicotine. The use of a unique iodinated nicotine derivative in
this procedure uave a sensitivity of 10 wail for nicotine with a between-run pre-
cision of 7.4% and within-run precision of 6.0%. Nicotine levels of 60 to 67

Introduction

 

Conventional assay’ methods for detection of nicotine in biological fluids are
laborious and not very sensitive. Radioimmunoossays for many low molecular
weight substances have been developed by our group and by others {1—7].

Recent reports indicate that antibodies produced by conjugation of nicotine
to protein carriers have been of low titer and specificity 18,9]. Hence nicotine
rulhoimmunoasay methouls have licked sensitivity and accuracy. The long
incubation periods dictated Uy the previously described methods have com-
Pounded the difficulty of obtainng data with the specd and convenience neces-
sary for many clinical and research applications. We recently reported the pro-
jon of nicotine antibody of high Liter in goals using 64¢-aminocapramido)-
Snicotme-BSA (bovine serum albumin) conjugate as the immunogen {1}.
The assay method employed, however, had shurteomings similar to the ones
reported by other workers.
