Previous studies have shomn that the fibrin(oges) pentapeptii
GA, Ala-Arg-ProvAla-Lys (residues 43-47 of the BB chain of huaan
fibrinogen) is released by plasnin (1). The peptide, hereafter
called GA, increases wicrovescular permeability. This affect of
4A aay be of special Amporcance in that the extravascular fibrino-
lyete of the adult respiratory distress syadrone is associated
with the development of profound pulsonary edema (2).

   

   

Tecently, ve have found that 6A ie a moderately potent inhibitor
of angiotensin converting enzyne (3). As expected, 6A can inhibit
the conversion of angiotensin I into angiotensin Ii and can poten
