Introduction

Louisiana became of epidemiological concern hecause
mortality rates due to respiratory system cancers (RSC) in
‘white males were the highest in the nation according to Ma-
son and MeKay’s 1950-1969 data." Of Louisiana's 64 parish-
ts (counties). 34 had rates in the top 10 per cent nationally.
‘To update parish-specifc rates of morality attributable to
RSC in Louisiana. and to investigate clustering and the sta-
bility of geographic trends over time, we determined rates,
for 1967-1976

 

Methods

From death certificates signed by physicians in Louisi-
ana, and supplied by the State of Louisiana. Department of
Health and Human Resources, Office of Heaith Services and
Environmental Quality. we obtained data on deaths resulting
from RSC during 1967 to 1976 in each ofthe state's 64 parish-
5, Respiratory system cancers were represented by the 8th
revision of the International Classification of Diseases code
hhumbers 162-163,? which are consistent with the categories
(of the 6th revision used by Mason and MeKay. Audit of
Louisiana death certificates during 1967-1976 showed that
approximately 94 per cent of deaths listed as caused by RSC
Were reported as lung, bronchus. and trachea cancer.” We
inelided the last three years of Mason and MeKay’s study in
ur data to achieve more stability in our estimates of rates.
‘Age-specific denominator dats for each parish were based on
the April 1972 population linearly extrapolated from the 1960
land 1970 census data, for each race and sex. We age-adjust-
td the average annual rates of mortality due to RSC by the
Gireet method, using the 1960 U.S. population as a stan~
dard

For each parish. the observed age-adjusted average an-
ual rates of mortality attributable to RSC for 1967-1976
‘Were compared with expected rates based on the increase in
the state since 1980-1969. The expected mortality rate for
1967-1976 in each parish was calculated as follows: the ratio

Results

When the average annual mortality resulting from RSC
in Louisiana for 1950-1969 was compared with that for 1967-
1976, an increase in rate was noted for exch of the four race
sex groups (Table 1), Although the age-adjusted rate for
males continues o be strikingly higher than that for females.
the rates for females increased more than those for their cor-
responding male groups. The rates increased more for white
than for nonwhite groups. White males had inereased rates
in every parish except West Feliciana: white Females. in all
‘but four parishes: nonwhite.males. in all but four parishes

"We used Bailar and,Ederer’s formula to assess the sig-
nificance of fuctuations in rates in individual parishes. espe-
Cally in those having sparse populations or small numbers of|
Geaths resulting from RSC. The total of 26 deviations from
