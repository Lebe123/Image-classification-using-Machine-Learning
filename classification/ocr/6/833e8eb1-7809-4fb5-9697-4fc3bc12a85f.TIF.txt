Redaction of Biological Effuents in Purge and Trap Micro
‘Reaction Vessels and Detection of Endothelium-derived Niesie

(Receised 16 Aprit 1990, occeped 27 Devember 1990)

Various analytical approaches have been used to mearare

Nitric Oxide is detected by its reaction with
ozone (NO+O,= = >NO*, 40,25
>NO+O, +hv). The basic Nitric Oxide
Analyser (NOA Model 270, Sievers Research,
Ine., Boulder, CO, USA) has been described
in detail [7]. The modified purge and trap
micro reaction venel J. Pirolo, Alhambra,

ing unit made of boraslicate glass, 75
‘om «127 cm, witha glass bulb (3.7 €m) at the
top. The sice arm on the bulb leads to a micro
‘condensing unit, the other end of which is
connected by a high vacuum stopcock to the
Nitric Oxide Analyser. The bottom of the
urging device is fitted with a medium poro-
Sity gla fr and is connected by a U-tube and
an oblique high vacuum stopcock 10 an inlet

introduction and removal of samples. A heat
ing coil, connected to @ proportional heater
goutrol, is wound around the purge vesel,
‘The condensing unit is cooled by ice water

Palmer, Chicago, IL, USA).

In a typical experiment, the purge vese!
maintained at 65°C, is evacuated to O- Torr.
2 ml of a 1% solution of Nal in glacial acetic
acid is injected into the device through a
Septum (Hewlett-Packard, PA) and i re-
fluxed under reduced presure. The vapors
condense back into the vesel, 0.5 mi of the
cfflvent is collected from the generator in a2
‘ml pressure-lock gas syringe (Dynatech Pre-
