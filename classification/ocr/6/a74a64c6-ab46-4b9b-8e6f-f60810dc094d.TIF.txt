Sumacy - Evidence which suggests the occurrence of a rapid new menbrane
assenbly has been observed in the secretory granules of the rat peritoneal
mast cell during the early stage of granule activation. The rapid insertion
of these newly generated vesicles enables the perigranulat nenbrane of the
activated granule to enlarge and expand prior to fusion with the plasna
menbrane and/or with the neighboring granule menbranes. If the newly inserted
membrane represents "specialized fusogenic membrane patches", then the
Presence of de novo menbrane generation as an integral step in the mechanism
of mast cell granule exocytosis would constitute a fail-safe mechanism in
histamine release, © 1o#s acadeste ress, te.

 

‘Overwhelming evidence has suggested that granule matrix swelling and the
enlargement of the perigranular menbrane are early morphological indicators of
mast cell granule activation (1-3). Since excess membrane in the form of
folds or inclusions has riot been observed in the quiescent granule and it is
known that menbrane cannot stretch beyond 2-38 of its original area (4), it is
necessary to consider that new menbrane is generated during granule
activation, Fusion of this newly generated menbrane with the perigranular
membrane would enable the granule to expand and the perigranular menbrane to
Lift from the surface of the granule matrix.

By using various ultrastructural techniques, we found that: First,
rapid-freezing and freeze-substitution of mast cells reveals the presence of
menbeane vesicles associated with activated or secreted granules. Second,
purified granules after removal of their perigranular membrane can generate
membrane vesicles, And third, membrane vesicles and the fusion of these
vesicles with the petigranular menbrane have been observed using a
simultaneous activation, fixation, and menbrane enhancenent (SAFME) procedure,
