Does breathing other people’s tobacco smoke cause lung cancer?

NICHOLAS J WALD, KIRAN NANCHAHAL, SIMON G THOMPSON, HOWARD $ CUCKLE

Abstract

‘The available epidemiological studies of lung cancer and
exposure to other people's tobacco smoke, in which exporure
was assessed by whether or not a persoa classified a8 5 noot
smoker lived with a smoker, were ideatifed and the results
‘combined. There were 10 case-control studies and three pros:
Dective studies, Overall, there was a highly signieant 25%
‘ncrease inthe risk of ung cancer among n08-tokers Living with

sokers compared with non-smokers ving with noa-smekers
(relative risk 1.35, 95% confidence interval 1-19 to 1-5), Part of
this increase was almost certainly caused bythe miscassication
of some smokers as non-smokers. As snokers, who are more
Uhely to get lung cancer than non-smokers, tend to live with
smokers this misclassifcation probably exaggerated the cti-
‘mated increase in sk. Adjusoment for this error reduced the
estimate to 30% (relative risk 130), But ax people who Live with
son-smokers may stil be exposed to ther people's smoke his
‘esate was revised again to allow for the fact that a truly
‘nexposed reference group was not used. The increase ia ak
‘among noa-smokers ving with smokers compared with a
Somoley aesposed group was ths etimated at 3% (elatie
Hakor 53).

“This analysis, and the fact that non-smokers breathe environ:
‘mental tobacco smoke, which contains carcinogens, into their
fogs and thatthe generally accepted view is that there is no safe
threshold forthe effect of carcinogens, leads to the conclision
‘that breathing other people's tobacco smoke isa cause of lung.

Introduction

1 has been shown chat aos-smokers who live with smokers are
senerally more exposed to other people's tobacco smoke, and that
heir exposure is greater both inside and outside the home, than
nonsmokers. ving. with non-imokers.” The epidemiological
sudies that have compared the Fisk of lung cancer in these two
ous of noa-smokers therefore provide a valid means of asceing

the effect of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (passive

smoking”). Few of tbe studies have thown a tiuiicant risk of
Jung cancer associated with exposure o such smoker but dus canoet
be taken as negative evidence because most ofthe fades were foo
ssnall to detect the small exces ik that would be expected. To
‘vercome this problem we present here an analysis that combines
the results from all 13 studies. ‘We have also interpreted the
callecive evidence and judged whether there it a causal sociation
bberween exposure tenvironmental tobacco imoke and lung cancer.
