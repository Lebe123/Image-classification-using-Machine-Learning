ROLE OF DNA SYNTHESIS IN SECRETION OF IMMUNOGLOBULIN FROM
MURINE B CELLS STIMULATED BY T CELL DERIVED LYMNPHOKINES'

We have investigated whether cell division is re-
quired for induction of Ig secretion from three types
4b cells, which represent distinct activation
States: normal splenic B cells, anti-lgtreated B
ells, and a monoclonal murine B cell tumor, BCL1.
Polyclonal Ig secretion was stimulated in vitro by
1PSor by lymphokines produced by EL-4 cells (EL
4N), which includes B cell growth factor 11 (BCGF
{}, LPS and F1-4 SN were mitogenic for all three cell

‘pulations and stimulated substantial IgM secre-
{ion from both B cells and anti-lg blasts. Aphidi-
colin, a reversible inhibitor of DNA synthesis, abol-
{shed IgM secretion from B cells and antitg blasts
induced by either mitogen, indicating that Ig-secret-
ing cells in these cultures are part of a cycling
population. BCL, tumor cells respond to BCGF It
{but not to interleukin 2 or B cell stimulatory factor
1) with IgM secretion and cell division, allowing a
direct assessment of the influence of BCGF Il-stim-
ulated cell division on secretion of IgM. Secretion
by these cells during the first 24 hr of culture was
not substantially affected by aphidicolin, but secre-
tion at 48 or 72 hr was markedly inhibited. Culture
of BCL, cells for 48 hr with aphidicolin alone had
no effect on cell viability or on subsequent respon-
siveness if the drug was removed, eliminating non-
specific toxicity as an explanation of the drug's
effect. Addition of aphidicolin during the last 24 hr
of culture to either normal B cells or BCL, cells was
much less effective at inhibiting IgM ‘secretion.
‘These results indicate that the cells that secrete IgM
in response to BCGF Il also synthesize DNA when
exposed to this factor. Thus, induction of high-rate
Ig secretion from murine B’cells by some stimuli,
including BCGF 11, may require at least one round
of cell division,

 

During the course of an immune response in vivo, B.
cells both proliferate and secrete immunoglobulin (Ig) (1).
tail the dependence of Ig secretion upon cell division is
tincertain. Initiation of cell division does not in itself
activate Ig secretion, since some stimull are capable of
Inducing resting B cells to divide without secreting Ig (2.

SF-1 and anti- resting 1 cells biast and knvlergo mi:
tosis but do not secrete IgM (4-6). These cells mature to
Ig secretion Af other 7 cell factors are tncluded tn the
cultures (6). A subpopulation of 1 cells nay be able to
differentiate without passing through 8, since Anders:
son, Melcher and co-workers (7, 8) have reported that
certain sources of T cell factors stimulate IgM secretion
without Inducing cell division. However, a single round
of diviston could have gone undetected in these studies

Recent data from Swain, Dutton, and co-workers (9
11) suggests that B cell growth factor It (HCGF I induces
IgM sceretion as well as cell division in susceptible 1
cells: a factor with similar activity has also been de-
seribed by other investigators (12-14). At present, the
mitogenic activity of BCGF IN has not been separated from
Activity that induces IgM secretion. However, because the
cells used In these assays are helerogencous, IC Is not
known if the target populations for factor-dependent
growth and differentiation ace the same.

“The close association of the activities that induce
growth and Ig secretion led us to determine whether ell
division was essential for the induetion of Ig secretion
from BCL, cells and normal Beells. Aphidicottn, a fangal
product highly specific for DNA polymerase 1, was used
o inhibit DNA synthesis because IIs relatively nontoxte
(15); these properties have led fo its frequent use as a
means to synchronize dividing ells. We found that apht
icolin was a potent inhibitor of lg seerction from thece

lymphokines or LPS.
