Lung cancer is currently the leading cause of cancer death in the
United States and also the most common tumor worldwide. Changes
in the distribution of histologic types over the past two decades in the
United States. as well as high rates of lung cancer in certain subpopula

pational exposures are firmly established as important risk factors for
lung cancer. recent work provides evidence that other factors may play
a role either as independent risk factors or as modifiers of the eifect of
smoking. This paper reviews the epidemiology of lung cancer. with an
emphasis on developments in the past decade. 1993 Wiley-Liss. tne

INTRODUCTION
‘The Magnitude of the Problem

‘The United States is currently in the sixth decade of
an epidemic of lang cancer. Lung cancer isthe leading
cause of cancer mortality in bath sexes, acouatin
fn estimated 146.000 deaths in the United States in
1992. of 34% of cancer deaths in males and 224 in
femaies (l]. The American Cancer Society projects
«hat 168,000 new cases will be diagnosed in 1992, ace
counting for 18% of new cancers in males and 12% in
females (I]. Between 1930 and 1987 the age-adjusted
lung cancer morality rate increased from 4 to 74 cases
per 100,000 in males and from 4 to 27 in females (1).
During the past few years. lung cancer incidence rates
in males have begun to level off. But those in females
have continued to rise. It is clear from these figures
that lung cancer will remain a major public health
problem for decades to come.

‘While tung cancer incidence in males is approaching
its peak in the United States, rates in developing coun-
tries are increasing, presaging a globalization of the
epidemic [2], Lung cancer is already the most common
tumor worldwide 2)

Differences in age-adjusted incidence rates for spe-
cific histologic types of lung cancer by sex. race. and
calendar time period suggest that different histologic
types may have diferent etiologies. In white men in the

United States. rates of adenocarcinoma and oat cell
carcinoma increased over the period 1969-1988, while
therate of squamous cell carcinoma decreased. in white
‘women. all major types showed an increase (3.

histological type among males. whereas adenocarci-

smokers. the proportion of adenocarcinoma is greater
than in smokers (4), and partculatly so in females.
reaching 78% in one series of lung cancer cases in
nonsmoking women (5]

While cigarette smoking and specific occupational
‘exposures have been firmiy established as important
risk factors for lung cancer, over the past decade there
hhas been increasing recognition that smoking and cc-
cupational exposures may not explain al ofthe varia-
tion in lung cancer incidence within countries and be-
(ween countries, and that other factors may play a role
cither as independent nsk factors or as modifiers of the
eifect of smoking. Some issues that remain to be eluci-
dated include (1) the high rates of lung cancer in Chi-
nese women, who have a low prevalence of smoking;
(2) the higher incidence of lung cancer in black Ameri-
