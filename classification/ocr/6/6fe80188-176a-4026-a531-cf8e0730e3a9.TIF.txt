Human platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)
tent mitogen for mesenchymal-derived cells, such #8 dip-
loid fibroblasts, arterial smooth muscle celle. and glial
cells (or a review ace Antoniades and Owen, 1984; Wes
termark et al, 1983). In vivo, PDGF is apparently syn
thesized by ‘megakaryocytes and transported in blood
stored in the alpho-granules of ploteleis. These celle
have an affinity for iyured sites aggregating there and
Feleasing ther contents. ‘Thus the patceta selectively
deliver PDGF to sites of injury, where it participates in
the process leading to wound healing und tissue
remodeling.

‘PDGF consists of two homologous polypeptide chains
(PDGF. and PDGF-2) inked together by disulfide bonds
(Antoniades and Hunkapiller, 1983; Johnason etal.
3984) The gene encoding the PDGF-1 chain has been
localized ‘on chromosome 7 (Betsholtz. et al. 1986) No
viral gene homolog to the cellular PDGF i gene has
been identified as yet. The PDGF-2 polypeptide chain
‘wag shown to be encoded by the simian sarcoma viral
(SSV) oncogene (v-sis (Doolittle et al, 1983, Waterfield
‘etal, 1983) und by its cellular counterpart e-sts Josephs
cet al, 1984; Chiu et al, 1984), which is localized in
‘chromowome 22 (Swan etal. 1982; Dalla Favera et al.,
1982). The PDGF gene protein products have been iden:
tified in SSV-transformed cells and mn several human
rmaligmant coll lines of mesenchymal origin, whoce nor.
