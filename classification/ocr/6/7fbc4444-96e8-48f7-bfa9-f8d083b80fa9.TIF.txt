[Abstract—Maava E., Cones A. Satrssn P., CHewon M. and Gouensce J, 1989. Deleterious synergistic
effects of ascorbate and copper onthe development of Plasmodium faliparum: a in vir study in normal
and in G6PD-deficient erythrocyes. Zaternatonal Jounal for Pareiology 19: 779-78S. The eects of
ascorbate and copper on the development of Plasmodium falciparum were studied in two modes:
pretreatment of uninfected erythrocytes followed by infection by P.aliparum and ureaiment of parasitized
erythrocytes. Pretreatment of G6PD(+) cells with ascorbate caused a slight enhancement in par
development, while in G6PD(—) cell a suppressive effect on the plasmodia was demonstrates. Copper
alone interfered with parasite growth in both cel types. The combination of copper and ascorbate eresed
parasite maturation, an effect which was more pronounced in GEPD(~) ells. Synergism between copper
and ascorbate was better demonstrated following the reatmen of infected erythrocytes: while ascorbate
alone supported parasite development and copper alone had only a marginal suppressive effec, the
ombination of copper and ascorbate yielded a marked inhibition of paresite growth. Ascorbate proved
destructive tothe parasites inthe presence of edventitious copper, or of the second day of the parasite life
cycle. In these cases it acted asa pro-oxidant, while in other systems. in particular in the presence of a
chelator, ascorbate acied es an antioxidant and promoted parasite growth, The understanding of the role of
‘ransition metals and free radicals in parasite development and injury could shed light on novel approaches
to fight malaria

INTRODUCTION
‘Oxtoarive challenge may affect the plasmodia at each
of its developmental stages including recognition of
host cells, penetration and intracellular development
of the parasite (Golenser & Chevion, in press). For
example, such a challenge may cause lipid per-
oxidation (Stocker, Hunt, Buffinton & Weidemann,
1985) or lead to the formation of methemoglobi
(Wozencraft, Dockrell, Taverne, Targett & Playfair,
1984) that, in turn, may interfere with plasmodial
growth. Likewise, in vivo studies using the mouse
model have indicated that parasitemia is depressed by
the oxidant stress-generating xenobiotic alloxan
(Clark & Hunt, 1983), The effect of alfoxan could be
prevented by prior administration of the potent iron
chelator desferrioxamine, These results are in full
accord with the proposed catalytic role of transition
metals in free radical-induced damage in a variety of
biological systems (Chevion, 1988).

During the development of

high levels of iron takes place within the red blood cell
Ganney, Joist & Fitch, 1988). In this study, we have
chosen to use adventitious copper as an exogenous
metal in order to allow discrimination between the
effects of the endogenous and added metals,
Additionally, copper per se is known to act as an
‘oxidant agent on red blood cells (Metz, 1960; Boulard,
Blume & Beutler, 1975) even at concentrations
compatible to its contamination in the environment

The effects of copper should be better demonstrated

deficient erythrocytes which are more sensitive to
oxidizing challenge (Friedman, 1979; Roth, Raventos-
Suarez, Rinaldi & Nagel, 1983; Golenser, Miller,
Spira, Navok & Chevion, 1983). In this investigation
wwe have examined the effect of adventitious ascorbate,
copper and a chelator (diethylenetriamine pentaacetic
acid—Detapac) upon the development of P.
falciparum in normal and in  G6PD-defcient
erythrocytes. It has been shown that ascorbate can act
both as an antioxidant and as a pro-oxidant
