Summary.

Donperidone, a dopamine receptor antagonist vhich apparently does
Bot penetrate the blood-brain barrier in rats was administered to
adult males. Dosperidone 500 pg and 100ug, given through
intracarotid cannula, significantly elevated plasma prendorphtn~
inounoreactivity (-EP-I) at #15 ein. To show that only a
peripheral site(s) of action is implicated, domeridone was given
fo rats by canutlae implanted into both lateral venteicles.

Plasma BrEP-I was unaffected by this route of adainistration.
These results suggest that plasya -EP-I is tonically inhibited by
dopamine acting at site(s) outside of the blood-brain barrier.

 

Plasma rendorphin (f-EP) levels are thought to reflect secretion from.the
anterior pituitary gland. Plasua B-EP usually responds to the sane agents and :
influences which modulate plasma S-lipotropin (G-Ltll) and advenocortieotropia,

(AcTH) (1-3), Although most studies indicate that these peptides are secreted
coordinately, recentiy dexamethasone was shown to suppress plasae B-EP levels

without affecting B-LPH (4). This suggests that sone pituitary cells may secrete

nostly PEP into the systenic cirevlation.

 

 

‘The pituitary intermediate lobe contains high concentrations of B+EP-like
Peptides derived from the same pro-opionelanocortin precursor found in the
anterior lobe(S-7). In vitko experiments have shova that the iatermediate lobe
responds to a different set of agents than those effecting secretion from the
anterior lobe and dopanine has been shown to suppress intermediate lobe secretion
of PEP-Like peptides(8,9). Recently, dopaminergic regulation of canine and rat
plasma B-EP-I has been observed (10-12). This is inhibited by pre-infusion with
Gopanine or other dopamine receptor antagonists. We sought to extend these
observations to the rat and to evaluate whether a dopamine receptor antagonist
activates secretion of B-EP-I only at a site(s) outside of the bloodsbrain
Partier. Domperidone, a dopamine receptor antagonist which may not cross the
Dlood-brain barrier vhen aduinistered peripherslly, was chosea to investigate
these issues (13).
