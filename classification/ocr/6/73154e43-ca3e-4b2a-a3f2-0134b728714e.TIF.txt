Fora study of the long-term effects on
humans of low levels of cadmium and of
the possible role of cadmium in chronic
diseases, it is essential that accurate data
on existing levels and distributions of
cadmium body burden be available.

low levels of exposure, and also to serve
as reference data for monitoring changes
inthe body burden of future populations.

sy studies: at age $0, an American has an
