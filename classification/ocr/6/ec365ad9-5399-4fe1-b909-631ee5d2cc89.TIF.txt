Summary

A DNA-DNA (‘Souther’) dot hybridization technique was adapted for use as a quantitative DNA
erection method during alkaline elution analysis of irradiated rat cell material. In comparison to standard
‘microfluorometric methods, similar y-ray dose-response relationships were obtained with less than 1% of
the cell material when the dot hybridization assay was used. When a highly repetitive, long interspersed
DNA element of the rat genome is used as a hybridization probe, as few as 10 cells of rat tissue or rat cell,
culture cells per sample with approx. $0 ng of DNA were sufficient to detect single-strand breaks and
protein crosslinks in the DNA of rat hepatocytes and cells of the nasal epithelium after in vitro
‘yirradiation. Since highly repetitive DNA elements are available from nearly all higher eukaryotes, this
alterative approach of detecting DNA in alkaline elution analysis is generally proposed for tissues which
yield only low amounts of cell material and /or which are difficult to label by radioactive DNA precursors.

 

‘The alkaline elution analysis technique intro-
duced by Kohn and Evi in 1973 is widely used in
genetic toxicology to determine chemical-or radi-
ation-induced DNA damage after in vitro or in
vivo exposure to genotoxic substances. DNA.
single-strand breaks were originally detected by
this method. With modifications, alkaline elution
can also be used to detect DNA protein cross-links,
DNA-DNA interstrand cross-links, and alkali:
