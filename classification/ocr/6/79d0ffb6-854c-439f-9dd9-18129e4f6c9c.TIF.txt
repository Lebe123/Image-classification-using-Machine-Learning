“Abstract By using a rat x opioid receptor cDNA as a probe to screen a human brain cDNA library,
‘ve isolated a 4.0-kb clone (2115) which encompasses a major portion of a human x opioid receptor
{hkoo, extending from the artno acid residue #6 to the 3-untranslated region. The extreme 5'-
region usp Segment of cL3 was used asa probe to screen a human genomic DNA rary,
TLo-kb fragment (42) of one postive clone was found to extend from S-untranslated region (0
beyond the exonfntron junction at residue Argl6. The genomic DNA fragment d2 and the cDNA
clone 2115 were assembled to generate a clone (42-2115) containing the entire coding sequence of
koe. Clone d2-z115 has an open reading frame of 1140 bp, which encodes for a 380-amino acid
protein. The deduced amino acid sequence has 93.9% and 93.2% identity to rat and mouse «
Receptors, respectively. Tealso displays ~ 60% identity to both human j and & receptors. Northern
‘lot analysis showed that in the human brain there was a single hkor mRNA transcript of 6.0 kb.
‘Among brain regions examined, tie amygdala, caudate nucleus, hypothalamus and subthalamic
tiucleus contained high levels of hkor mRNA. Fikor was cloned into the expression vector pBK-
iy expressed in COS-1 cells. Hkor had high affinity for (41 diprenorphine, a
ntagonist, and displayed stereospecific binding to naloxone. selective ligands
IND) had high aftinites, whereas. and 8 selective ligands bound with much
lower affinities, Dynorphin A (I-17) and a-neoendorphin, both endogenous x peptides, bound with
high ainies. ‘These binding characteristics confirmed that hkor isa x receptor, most likely type.
Cloning ofthe human xteceptor allows investigation of iterations of compounds with the human
receptor, instead of rodent receptors, for development of beter therapeutic agents.
