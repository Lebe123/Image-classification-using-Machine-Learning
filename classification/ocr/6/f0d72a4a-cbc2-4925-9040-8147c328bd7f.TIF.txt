ntoles
Certain steroids (e.9., spironolactone, nozbolethone, cthylestrenol)
increase’ the ectivity of NADPH-dependent mixed-funetion oxygeneses in
Liver microsomes and enhence the hydroxylation of various coapounds,
thereby facilitating their clearence from blood (1-3). This steroid
action, which is independent of all other hormonal ectivities (4,5),
explains the previously obsezved resistence-incressing, or “catatoxic”,
effect ageinst intoxicetions elicited by a wide variety of structurelly
unreleted substances (6-8).° In a recent large-scale in vive screening
progrem, during hich moze than 300 steroids wore tested, 3p-hydroxy-
20-oxo-5-pregnene-1éa-cezbonitrile [pregnenolone-Iée-cazbonitzile (Pax)

was found to be the most active in preventing intoxication with

 

Stattoxin, dtoxethion, sndonethecin or dihyerotechjetorel and in étain
{ening the anesthetic or perslysing effects of necobarbltel, progesterone
ts vell a6 zoxazolanine (9)10). Tt therefore tecned of interest to
soy the Unfluince of FH on the abeed-functicn oxygenese eysten in
the rat liver, and to correlate its remarkable resistence-increasing

effect with the metsbolic alterstions,

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Female ARS/Sprague-Davley rats (ledison, Wisconsin, U.S.A.), with
2 meen initial body weight of 100 g (range 95-105 9) and mzintained

compounds given are, expressed per 100 g body weight.
