We have explored the structure and pattern of

expression of a gene designated mdm-J, which
plified 25~30-fold in transformed mouse cells cont
ing numerous double minute particles. This gene is
‘expressed in all mouse tissues examined but exhibits
‘elevated and altered patterns of expression in the tes-
‘Multiple transcripts are generated from the mdm-

ia mechanisms of alternative splicing and pol-
yadenylation signal choice. These mlNAs have the
potential to produce a minimum of three distinct pro-
tein products ranging in size from 26 to 77 kilodaltons.
‘Antiserum generated against a synthetic peptide from
the midm-1 gene was used in immunoblotting studies
‘and rovealed that at least one of the protein products
is present in the nucleus. This antiserum stained
nuclear structures producing a distinct punctate or
speckled pattern,

 

 

 

      

 

 

 

 

‘A number of genes have been implicated in altered growth,
control pathways associated with cellular transformation
(Bishop, 1987). Clues leading to the identity of some of these
genes have come from cancer cells themselves in the form of
Consistent chromosomal changes. These changes include s

tifie deletions and translocations, as well as the appearance
‘of double minute chromatin particles (DMs)' in some tumor
cells, DMs are small, acentromerie chromatin bodies that
result from a process of gene amplification. DMs are rately,
if ever, observed in normal cells but have been described in a
variety of tumor cells and transformed cell lines (George,
1984), and in cells sclected for resistance to various antime:
tabolites (Sehimke, 1984; Stark and Wabl, 1984). A deimon-
stration thatthe appearance of DMs results from the aberrant
replication and/or recombination of @ segment of genomic
DNA initially came from studies of marnmalian cells selected
for resistance to the drug methotrexate (Alt et al, 1978).
‘Analysis of such methotrexate-resistant cells, as well as cells

selected for resistance to 0 number of other drugs, has pro
Vided evidence that cells containing DMs most likely are
selected for and niaintained in the population because the
TMs contain amplified copies of one or more genes, which
‘confers resistance to the eytotoxic agent, Removal of the drug,
and the selective pressure it imparts, results in rapid loss of
DMs (Alt et al, 1978; Kaufinan et al, 1979)

Tn contrast, DMs ire stably maintained in tumor cells in
the absenice of obvious selective pressure. Therefore, it is
likely that the amplified DNA on the DMs confers some
growth advantage tothe host ell. Indeed, amplified sequences
[resent in a number of rnor cells and transformed cel lines
‘often include proviously characterized proto-oncogenes or re-
lated genes (George, 1984). These data suggest that the
plication and consequent overexpression of particular genes
may play a central role in some processes of transformation

‘We are exploring the functional significance of amplified
DNA sequences located on DMs in a spontaneously trans:
formed mouse cell ine. These 3T3DM cells contain an average
‘of 25-30 DMs snd exhibit growth properties characteristic of|
‘ransformed cells, including growth in soft agar and tumor
Formation in nude mice (Cahilly-Snyder etal, 1987). We have
‘obtained evidence that none of 20 previously identified on-
cogenes, growth factors, oF growth factor receptor genes are
“amplified in these cells (Cahilly-Snyder et al, 1987). However,
the DMs are stable in the 3T3DM cells and therefore may
‘well contain @ previously unidentified gene with poter
transforming activity or influence in the control of cellular
proliferation. To begin to characterize the origins and nature
fof the amplified DNA sequences, we had previously con
structed a 3T3DM eDNA library and isolated clones repr
senting to genes that are amplified and overexpressed in
these cells (Cahilly-Snyder et al, 1987). ‘These two gene
designated mdm-1 and mdm-2, are amplified approximately
D5-fold relative to control cells. As reported elsewhere, in
normal cells these genes map to mouse chromosome 10, region
C1-C8 (Cahilly-Snyder etal, 1987). This region of the genome
thas not becn previously implicated in transformation or al-
tered growth control

‘As one approach to further characterize the amplified ma-
terial in the 3T3DM cells, we have anslyzed the sequence and
pattern of expression of the amplified mdm-1 gene. As pre
ented in this report, we have found that the mdm-7 gene is
subject to complex transcriptional processing, with the poter
tial to produce « number of polypeptide products. Atleast one
‘of these proteins is present in the nucleus.
