The Effects of Nicotine on Attention, Information Processing, and
Short-Term Memory in Patients with Dementia of the Alzheimer Type

. These results suggest that nicotine

      

‘may be acting on cortical mechanisms involved in veual perception and atterton, and support
{he hypothesis that acetycholine transmission modulates viglance and discrimination, Nicotine
‘may therefore be of some value in treating deficits in attention and information processing

 

in DAT patients

‘The cholinergic hypothesis of ageing and dementia
attributes impairment of memory and cognition to
‘reduced central cholinergic function (Drachman &
Sahakian, 1979; Bartus er ai, 1982; Sahakian, 1988).
Critical evidence for this hypothesis isthe finding
thatthe degree of cognitive impairment in patients
with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) is
positively correlated with decrease of choline
acetyltransferase, and a reduction in acetylcholine
(ACH) syathess in brain, measured in post-mortem
and biopsy studies respectively (Perry et al, 1978;
Francis eta, 1985). In addition, both muscarinic and
nicotine receptors in cerebral cortex are decreased
in normal elderly subjects, and may be still further
reduced in the brains of patients with DAT (White
et al, 1977; Davies & Feisullin, 1981; Rinne ef a,
1984; Flynn & Mash, 1985; Candy et al, 1986).

Tt may therefore be possible to improve partially
the impairment in memory and cognitive function
‘of DAT patients with a cholinergic receptor agonist,
such as nicotine. Nicotine, in addition to its post-
synaptic action, may also act pre-synaptically, since
there is evidence for presynaptic nicotinic auto-
receptors promoting ACh release (Rowell & Winkler,
1984; Clarke et a, 1986). The purpose of this study
‘was (o investigate whether nicotine could enhance
performance on computerised tests of attention,
information processing, and short-term memory in
‘normal elderly subjects and patients with DAT.

 

 

 

Method

‘There were three groups: 7 young normal adults (@ men,
women, mean age 27 (£8.00 yet, dames); 7 elderly
‘ormal contol subjects (6 men, 1 woman, mean age 70
(2526 years, smokers; and 7 patients with DAT G men,
44 women, mean age 71 (46.02) years, 3 smokers). The

797

National Adult Reading Test (Nelson, 1982) was used to
match the thre groups for pre-morbi verballQ, with scores
‘of 12, 120, and 119 respectively. The young adults were
‘tudens nd community vlunter, and the edely controls
were community volunteers and the spouses of patents
Patients had been asesied at he Matdsley Hospital Memory
Clinie(Philpot Levy, 1987), and diagnosed by a consultant
psychiatrist in concordance with a second pejhistrist a8
faving DAT following the criteria oulined for ‘probable
Alzheimer's disease’ by Meihann el (1985). All patients
Selected were considered to bein the mild or moderate
stages ofthe disease, and fllin stages 1 or 2 the Clinial
Dementia Rating Scale (Hughes ea, 1982) Although the
numbers may appear smal, it should be empbasied that
itis dificult o obtain erly, well-dagnosed eases of DAT,
‘and to match them so closely wit controls.

‘Subjects and patients attended ening sesions followed
by seven test sesions inthe following order: an undrugged
baseline sesion, a placebo sesion (saline), three sessions
with nicotine (@.4mg, 0.6m, and 0.8 mg), 2 placebo
session, and an undrugged baseline session. Data fFom the
two baseline sesions and two plasbo sessions were summed
land the means calculated. Saline and nicotine were injected
Subcutaneously. During the 40-minute test sessions, the
patiens and subjets underwent a eres of texts of cognitive
Function, including the two computerised tests, the digit
span (forward) subtest ofthe Weehsler Adult Inteligence
Scale (WAS), the eral icker fasion test (an indirect.
measure of eotial arousal) (Smith & Misia, 1976), and
the finger-tapping task (a test of motor speed) West &
Savi, 1986)
