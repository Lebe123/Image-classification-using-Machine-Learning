Dual Effect of Nitrogen Dioxide on Rat
Alveolar Macrophage Arachidonate Metabolism

Timothy W. Robison and Henry Jay Forman

 

ABSTRACT: Significant deficits in alveolar macrophage (AM) function have been associated
‘with acute exposure t0 nitrogen dioxide (NOs. The present incestigation examined
changes in enzymatic production of arachidonate metabolites from rat AM exposed to
NO, While in vitro exposure of AM to NO; concentrations becween 0.1 and 5 ppm
alone hed small effets on basal synthesis of cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase products
‘exposure to either 1 ppm (2 or 4b) or 5 ppm (1b) markedly enhanced the sponse of AM
to stimulation by the calcium ionophore, A23187. This preexpesure led to significant
increases in eyclooxygenase products (thromboxane B, thromboxane), the stable metabo-
lite of thromboxane Ay and 12bydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid (12HHT) and lipo
‘genase products (leukotriene B (LTB) and monokydroxyeicosetetraenoate isomers) in
response to A23187. In contrast, « 1b exposure to 20 ppm NO; alone significantly
increased AM synthesis of thromboxane and 12-HHT, but suppresed the effect of subse
quently added A23187, Increased synthesis of cyclooxygenase products with 20 ppm NO,
alone were blocked with the phospholipase inhibitor mepacrine and the cyclooxygenase
inhibitor indomethacin. Toe lipoxygenase inhibitor nordibydroguaiaretc acid (NDGA)
significantly reduced release of arachidonate: however, levels of thromboxane and 12-
HHT were significantly increased. The results suggest a dual effect of NO, on AM
arachidonate metabolism in zwhich low concentrations of NO, had small effects on basal
metabolism but markedly amplified the response to stimuli while a high concentration
‘of NO; did the reverse. Such a complex dose-response effect may have significant impact
in explaining the pathlogic effets of NO,

Nitrogen dioxide (NO)) is a reactive gas formed by combustion processes,
‘most notably those that produce tobacco smoke, home gas stove emissions,
