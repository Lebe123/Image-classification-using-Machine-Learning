Abstract: Nicotine and its major metabolite coti-
fine inhibit a-hydroxylation of the tobacco-specif-
ic nitrosamine 4-methylnitrosamino)-1-G-pyridyD-
L-butanone (NNK) suggesting that an alternative
pathway of NNK metabolism and elimination, bit-
lary exeretion of the O-glucuronide of 4-(methyl-
nitrosamino)-1-G-pyridyl)-L-butanol_ (NNAL-Gluc)
‘may be enhanced. To verify the possible role of
cotinine on biliary elimination of NK and its me-
tabolites, bile duct cannulated rats were adminis-
tered a Single ip. dose of 50 mg/kg [5-2HI-NNK
with or without ip. co-administration of 5 mg/kg.
cotinine or nicotine. Cotinine significantly re~
duced cumulative bile flow and biliary elimination
of NNK-derived radioactivity within six hours to,
42 and 27 percent, respectively. The pattern of
NNK metabolites in bile was unchanged. Nicotine
| had 2 similar inhibitory effect on bile flow. This,
| result constitutes the first experimental evidence
that cotinine inhibits bile flow. In rats, biliary
elimination of NNK is reduced accordingly which,
i may lead to an increased carcinogen burden in
the body. In humans, inhibition of bile flow by to-
bacco alkaloids may contribute to the appetite
suppressing effect of tobacco products.

InTRopucTION

Besides bile acids and their cholates, cholesterol,
steroid hormones, proteins, lipids, bilirubin, and
‘other substances, such as xenobiotic metabolites,
are eliminated biliary, too. This elimination route
‘of toxic or carcinogenic compounds has been sug-
gested to be 2 risk factor of tobacco-related pan-
‘ereatic cancer [1]. ‘The tobacco-specific nitrosa~
mine 4-(methyinitrosamino)-1-G-pyridyD-1-buta-
none (NNK) and its metabolite 4-Cnethylnitrosa-
mino)-1-G-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) are the only
known agents from tobacco products that induce

fats treated with radiolabeled NNK the parent
compound and its metabolites NNAL and [4-
(methylnitrosamino)-1-G-pyridyDbut-1-yl-f-O-d-
glucosiduronic acid (NNAL-Glu) were discovered
in bile GFig. 1; BD. Therefore, it was suggested
that these potent carcinogens (4l may be trans-
ported to the pancreas by retrograde bile flow.
NNK and NNAL are procarcinogens requiring
