Abstract

‘The LSITRY /ok°/--3.7.2C mouse lymphoma assay (MLA) which detects mutations affecting the heterozygous th
dine kinase (rk) Tocus is capable of responding to chemicals acting as clastogens as well as point mutagens. Improvements in
the assay to enhance detection of this spectrum of genetic events are summatized, and criteria for evaluating the data af
‘defined. Using these criteria, the Phase II] Work Group reviewed and evaluated literature containing MLA results published

from 1976 through 1993. The data base included 602 chemicals of which 343 were evaluated as positive, 44 negative, 18
equivocal, $4 apparently inappropriate for evaluation in system with the published protocols, and 142 that were
inadequately tested, and thus a definitive call could not be made. The overall performance of the assay is summarized by
‘chemical class, and the outcome of testing 260 chemicals in the MLLA is compared with Gene-Tox and National Toxicology
Program evaluations of rodent carcinugenesis bioassay results for the same chemicals. Based on the Work Group's
evaluation of published MLA data for chemicals that were considered adequately tested, it is concluded that for most

SI7RY /K"7~ mouse lymphoma assay is eminently well suited for xenotoxicity testing and for predicting
