INTRODUCTION

‘There is great interest in the effecs of ventilation on the
chemisey of cigarette smoke. Filter ventilation, using
‘porous plig wrap and perforated tipping paper, decreases
‘condensate delivery and ths i important in view of the
rowing consumer preference for “low rar" brands (less
than 15 milligrams)

Low condensate cigaretes increased 10 34.58% of US. sales
in 1978, up by 9.6% (relative) from 1977 (1). Although
several researchers have studied smoke filtration in ven
slated cigaretes (2, 3 4, i was the purpose of this work
to.extend these investigations to include a broad range of
filter tow items and alzo several commercially used, ven-
tilaced filters. The data showed that ventilation gives a
basic design capability for controlling 2 number of smoke
parameters

 

MATERIALS AND METHODS

‘Two studies were performed to measure the effects of air
ventilation: one based upon testing filters made from
cellule acetate tows of increasing denier per filament
(dpf),and a second using commercial sir-ventlated filters.
Tn the first study, sx tow items were prepared in conven
tional filter construction, where the degree of ventilation
was varied by size and location of tipping paper perfor
ations. The second study involved smoking a number of
‘commercial filers all of which incorporated some physical
method for air dilation.

Figure 1 shows the construction of the reference cigarette
used in the first study. A series of these cigarettes was
prepared on commercial equipment using a 64 mm stan-
ard tobacco column, Two levels of ventilation were
achieved using MalaucineM 1.5 and M3.0 laserperforated
filer tip papers, where the coal atea of the holes in the
M3. paper was approximately ewice the open area of
the M-1.5 paper. In addition, control filters wsing non-
‘ventilated tipping were made. For each of the thre tip-
ping configurations, six tow items were tested for which
the pf canged from less than 1.5 to 5.0 and the total
denier varied from 40,009 to $0,000. Filter size, 25.0 mm
circumference and 21 mm length, was held constant. The
plug wrap was Schweitzer No. 912, having a Coresta

permeability of 26,000 cm per min. Ten percent (w/w)
triacetin was used asa plasticizer

In the second investigation, thirteen commercial filers
‘were hand-tipped to 2 64 mm standard tobacco column.
For both studies, presure drop, percent ai dilution, puff
‘count, particulate delivery, gas phate delivery of selected
‘components, and filtration efficiency were measured.
Particulate matter delivery was measured by the Federal
‘Trade Commission method (5). Particulate removal ef-
Ficiencies were derived according to Keith and Newsome
(6). CO was measured by gas chromatography (7), and
aldehydes were determined colorimetrically (8). The per-
cent dilution was the unit puff dilution volume, measured
by a bubble burette connected through encapsulation to
the ventilating perforations [cf. (4)]. The puff-by-puff
ventilation and tip pressure drop were assumed constant
throughout smoking of a cigarete (4). Standard instru-
mentation wae used for measuring physical parameters
(ecg cieumferenee, pressure drop) and the Coresta scan
dard smoking procedure was employed
