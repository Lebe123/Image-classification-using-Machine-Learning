SUMMARY—Carcinosenesis assay was conducted on subfractions of the
neuteal fraction (NF) of cigarette smoke condensate, subfractions that were
prepared by solvent partition. Of the 2 mojor subficctions, the “methanol-
ingoluble” neutrals (MIN) were much more active than’ the “methanol-
soluble” neutrals (MSN). Distibution of MSN between nitromethane ond
carbon disulfide yielded 2 ective fractions. Poot dose-response effects
suggest that extraneous materials may teduce the activity of MSN. Analysis
of the recovery of MSN is difficult, but opoarently there were significant
losses ducing separation. On countticurent distribution (CCD), MIN
yielded 3 octive and 2 inactive subfractions. Recovery of the activity of
MIN jn the subfractions was excellent in comparison with an eatlier separa-
ie acid chromatostophy. Recoveries might be improved if

silicic acid chromatography of the neutral frac-
te (CSC)
induced skin tumors in. mice. previously painted
with 125 ug of 7,12-dimethylbenafalanthracene
(DMBA) (1). With this procedure, tumor-promot~
ing agents as well as complete carcinogens were
detected. All the subfractions were recombined in
proportion to their yield, to provide a reconstituted
sample that would have been identical with NF if
no changes had occurred during the separation
procedure. The biological activity of this recon-
stituted material, however, was substantially less
than that of NF, suggesting that important amounts
of the active materials were lost during chroma-
tography. The current study was undertaken to
examine solvent partitioning alone as means of

 

 

fractionating NF, with the, hope that these loses
could be avoided.
