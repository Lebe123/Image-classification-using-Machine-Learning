ABSTRACT

Thousands of DNA deletion events occur during
macronuclear development in the ciliate Tetrahymena
thermophila. In two deleted genomic regions,
designated M and R, the eliminated sequences form
circles that can be detected by PCR. However, the
Circles are not normal products of the reaction pathway.
The circular forms occur at very low levels in
conjugating cells, but are stable. Sequencing analysis
showed that many of the circles (as many as 50% of
those examined) reflected a precise deletion in the M
and R regions. The remaining circles were either
smaller of larger and contained varying lengths of
Sequences derived from the chromosomal DNA
surrounding the eliminated region. The chromosomal
junctions left behind after deletion were more precise,
although deletions in either the M or R regions can
generate any of several alternative junctions (1). Some
ew chromosomal junctions were detected in the
present study. The results suggest that the deleted
segment is released as a linear DNA species that is
degraded rapidly. This species is only rarely converted
to the stable circles we detect. The deletion mechanism
is different from those proposed for deletion events in
hypotrichous ciliates (2-4), and does not reflect a
conservative site-specific recombination process such
as that promoted by the bacteriophage \ integrase (5).

 

INTRODUCTION

Ciliated protozoa provide examples of multiple types of
progratnmied genomic rearrangements (6). These organisms have
‘wo nuclei, a micronucleus and a macronucleus, The
‘mieromucleus is transeriptionaly inactive and isan analog of an
inactive germ cell nucleus. The larger macronucleus is
teanscriptionally active and is an analog of a somatic nucleus.

‘Nutritional starvation induces cels of different mating types
to undergo conjugation, The conjugants exchange haploid gametic
nuclei to form diploid zygotic nuclei. Subsequent steps include
mitotic divisions of zygotic nuclei the products of which give
rise to new micronuclei and macronuclei. Old macronuclei are
gradually degraded. In Tetrahymena thermophila, the entire
process is completed in about 20 h.

 

 

 

Macronuclear development in ciliates is accompanied by a
variety of DNA rearrangements, including the elimination of 3
substantial portion of the micronuclear genome (7). la
T.thermophita, about 15% of the genome is eliminated in the
form of about 6800 site-specific deletion events, averaging 2 Kop
insize and scatered about the genome. A striking feature otis
type of DNA rearrangement is its high efficiency and precision
Deletion ofall the MIC (micronucleus)-specifie sequences occurs
‘during a 2 period of macronuclear development, commencin
about 10— 12 after mating is initiated. The mechanism expioited
to bring about genomic deletions is unknown,

‘Three site-specific deletions in T.shermophila have been
characterized hy Yao and co-workers (6). They occur within &
short genomic region and are designated L, M, and R for let
‘middle, and right, respectively. The M region isthe best-stuied
Here, two different deletion events may occur, deleting either
600 or 900 bp (Figure 1B). The boundaries of the deleted
segments are marked by S$ or 8 bp terminal direct ry
although these have no identified role in the deletion process
Short polypurine tracts, found about 45 bp distal w each temninal
repeat, are required for deletion and represent the only cis-acting
sequences defined to dute tora ciliate deletion reaction (8. 9)
‘Their location defines the deetion erapoints inthe M region (9),
The polypurine tracts are absent in the neighboring R region,
hich also undergoes a deletion of 1.1 kbp (10)

A promising direction in the investigation of the mechanism
of genomic rearrangements in ciliates is analysis ofthe products
fr byproducts that appear during the process. In Euplotes erassus
the eliminated fragments derived from the deletion oi ES:
elements or the transposon-like Tee and Tee? elements can be
detected as circles (11 =13). The circle junctions contain 1wo
copies of the terminal direct repeat separated by a short se
of heteroduplex DNA derived from the chromosomal 1

authors to propose a detailed mode! for the deletion mechanism
The deleted TBEL elements of Osyzricha mifallax are also found
as readly-detected circular species with defined structures (4)

We have begun an investigation of genomic deletions in the
M and Ro regions during macronuclear development in
Thermophila. By weans of PCR techniques we have detected
circular forms of the eliminated sequences. However. the citcles
are found in much lower abundance than those observed in
