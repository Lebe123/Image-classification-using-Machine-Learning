 

THE ABILITY OF HUMAN SERUM TO AGGLUTINATE SHEEP

ERYTHROCYTES AND THE EFFECT OF

Comparison between Smokers and Nonsmokers!

In order to dovise a test suitable for determining
differences in man related to exposure to cigarette
smoke, serum of smokers and nonsmokers was
examined for the presence of tobacco mosaic
virus (TMV) antibodies and their ability to
agelutinate sheep erythrocytes. Carpenter and
Le Clair failed to detect antibodies to TMV in
the serum of patients with a variety of pathologic
processes or in the soruim of healthy’ subjects,
Despite these findings, an attempt was made to de.
tect TMV-specific antibodies in the serum of cigas
Fette emokers and to demonstrate other basic dite
ferences between the serum of emokers and that of
nonsmokers

One hundred and six scrum samples were ob-
tained from 44 cigarette smokers (82 ‘patients
with neoplastic disease and 12 apparently healthy
ersous) and G2 nonsmokers (40 children less
than 18 years of age and 22 healthy adults). The
blood specimens, after they were allowed vo clot
‘overnight at 4° C, were centrifuged at 2000 spa
for 10 minutes. The serum was collected, ested
fat 56° © for 30 minutes and stored at 4*'C unt
tested. For the purpose of contrast, the following
criteria were used in selecting subjects for the
study: cigarette smokers were selected if they.

collection; nonsmokers were selected i they
had never used tobacco products or had smoked
fgnly a few cigarettes, none in the past year.
Persons using tobscco ‘products sporadically were
‘ot studied because high contrast was desired.

A modification of the serologic test deseribed by
Moorehead and Price* was employed using =nicro-
titer plates The test was conducted es follows:
0.05 ml of saline was added to all wells; O15 tal
microtiter loops were used to dilute the serum
specimens; 0.05 ml microtiter loops were used to

dilute the TMV (870 wg per 005 ml), and then
005 ml of the 0.0625 per cent sheep erythrocytes
was added. To test the ability of the serum of
smokers and nonsmokers to agglutinate sheep or
hhuman erythrocytes, a similar procedure was used
omitting the TMV dilution step.

To test for TMV in cigarette extracts, a similar
procedure was used: 005 rl saline was added to
ach well; 005 ml of TMV-specifc rabbit serum
‘was loop-diluted; 0.05 ml of the cigarette extract
was loop-diluted, and 005 tl of 0.0625 per cent
sheep erythrocytes was added to each well. In all
cases, plates vgre incubated at 5° C for to hours
before being read for hemagglutination (HHA)
tere,

New Zealand white rabbits were injected intra-
venously with a total of 25 mg of TMV during «
monthly schedule and were bled by cardiac punc-
ture, The serum was collected and stored at minus
20" C until utilized.

Nationally known brands of cigarettes were
extracted a3 follows: 2 fresh pack of cigarettes
‘was opened with sterile instruments ina. sterile
44000 ml beaker, and all the tobacco was removed
(paper, filter material, et cetera, were discarded) ;
50 ml of Earle tissue ‘culture medium was added,
and the suspension was incubated overnight at
4 C. The suspension was passed through sterile
gauze pads to clear the estract, and the extract
was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 minutes. ‘The
supernatant ‘uid was collected and centrifuged
at 54000 g for two hours; the supematant fluid
was then discarded and the pellet resuspended in

Nicotiana glutinoea was emploved for deter-
mining the relative amounts of infective TMV.
‘Tobacco extracts, 02 mal per leaf, were applied to
the right side of leaves (top. middle. and bottom
leaves) with a sterile gauze sponge. Sterile tissue
culture medium was applied to the left half of
each leaf as a control. At three to seven days, the
‘number of plaques produced was scored.

Weights were determined after drving a known
volume of "TMV. stock or cigarette extract. to
constant weight at 105" C to 110° C,

 

 

 

No TMV antibodies were detected in the serum
of either cigarette smokers or nonsmokers, A dif-
ference was detected in ability of smokers’ and
nonsmokers’ serum to cause agglutination of sheep
cexythrooytes (0.0625 per cent) both in the presence
and absence of virus. The serum of 91 per cent of
the smokers produced HEA titers of 1:64 or less.
whereas the serum of 90 per cent of the non-
