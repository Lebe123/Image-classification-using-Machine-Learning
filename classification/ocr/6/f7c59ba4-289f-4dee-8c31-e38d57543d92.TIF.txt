Antigens will he labeled on a weight per volume basis. but the protein:
sitreen units (purl) andor at of protein nitragen/ml determination of te
PEA should also be indicated. Litwited data imply that concentrations tp to
420 can he stored at 4° C for one year. Anything more dilute than 1:20 should
be utilized within 7 days of preparation.
