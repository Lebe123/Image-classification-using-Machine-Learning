Our position, word by word.

Minors

 

No one should be allowed to sell cigarettes to minors.
‘Minors should not smoke. Period,

That is our position,

That's why Philip Morris developed a comprehensive
national program to prevent sales of cigarettes to minors,

‘The program, called “It’s The Law," reiterates to
retailers and to their employees that itis illegal to sell,
cigarettes to minors.

We all have a role to play in this effort: Educators.
Lawmakers, Parents. Communities. And, of course, the
tobacco industry.

At Philip Morris, we wil continue to work with our
retailers on this important issue.

For a free copy of our booklet, Smoking Issues, which
contains more information about the “I's The Law”
program, as well as information on other issues relating
to smoking, please call us at 1-800-852-3445, Ext. 219,
