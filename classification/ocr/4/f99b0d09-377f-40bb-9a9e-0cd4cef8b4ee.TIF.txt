#13 SIDES

SHE:

I don't know about you, but one issue I've been on both sides of is
Proposition 10. I like it because it sets up separate snoking and
non smoking sections. A nice, simple idea. And if it had
stopped there, it would get my vote. But it dnesn't stop there.
It goes on to provide for government regulators to come along

and run our lives and our businesses. And, it's full of things
like fines and the possibility of citizens arrest and heavy-handed
expensive bureaucracy and -- oh my, dozens of things that make

no sense-at’all. And the problem is: we can't vote for just

the nice, simple idea. If Proposition 10 becones law, all of

it becomes law. And I'd much prefer to leave most of it to

people's good common sense. Hell, I've decided to vote No on

Proposition 10. You, of course, will decide for yourself. But

do read it first.

This was paid for by Californians Against Regulatory Excess.
