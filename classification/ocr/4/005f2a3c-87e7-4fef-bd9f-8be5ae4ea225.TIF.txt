 

| Some straight talk
about smoking
for young people.

We're R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, and we're urging
you not to smoke.

We're saying this because, throughout the world,

. smoking has always been an adult custom. And
é because today, even among adults, smoking is
controversial.

Your first reaction might be to ignore this advice.
Maybe you feel we're talking to you as if you were a
child. And you probably don’t think of yourself that way.

But just because you're no longer a child doesn’t
mean you're already an adult. And if you take up
smoking just to prove you're not a kid, you're kidding
yourself.

Soplease don’t smoke. You'll have plenty of time as
an adult to decide whether smokingis right for you.

“hats about as straight as we can putit.
