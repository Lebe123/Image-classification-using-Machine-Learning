More than 1.9 million pieces of
material bearing this message have
been distributed to retailers
nationwide, including tips on how to
verify age and look for acceptable
forms of identification.

‘These retailers are participating
in a voluntary national program
because they do not want anyone
under 18 years of age to buy
cigarettes. They want to
demonstrate their support of existing

 

 

state laws prohibiting the sale of
tobacco products to minors. Philip
Morris salutes the many retailers who
are supporting the law. Our goal is to
work together to ensure that this sign
appears wherever cigarettes are sold.

If you would like to join the
thousands of retailers participating in
this program, please write to us of call
1-800-343-0975 and give us your name
and address. We'll send you a free
“I's The Law” kit.
