Second-hand smoke:
tS clear the air.

Can cigarette smoke in the air cause disease in non-smokers?

ThatSan emotional question for smokers and non-smokers alike.
Sowell try to set the record straight in the most direct way we know.

There is little evidence—and certainly nothing which proves
scientifically—that cigarette smoke causes disease among non-
smokers.

+ Youdon't have to take our word for it.

US. Surgeon General Julius B. Richmond—who was no friend of
smoking—said in his 1979 Report: “Healthy non-smokers exposed
to cigarette smoke have little or no physiologic response to the
smoke, and what response does occur may be due to psychological
factors”

Andin the 1982 Report, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop could
not conclude that passive smoking is a cause of cancer in non-
smokers.

The director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Dr.
Claude Lenfant, has been one of the tobacco industry’ sharpest .
critics. Yet Dr. Lenfant stated in 1980 (and we believe it remains true
today) that “the evidence that passive smoking ina general environ-
ment has health effects remains sparse, incomplete and sometimes
unconvincing”

We've decided to speak out on passive smoking because there is
so much rumor and rhetoric on this subject today. And we intend to
continue, from time to time, to speak out on other topics of concer
toyouand tous.

Our critics may try to discredit these messages as self-serving.
Ina sense, they will be right. We will challenge allegations that are
unproven and attacks we think are unfounded. If that is self-serving,
sobeit.

The. questions that surround smoking raise many important
issues. We believe that you're entitled to hear all sides of these
controversies.
