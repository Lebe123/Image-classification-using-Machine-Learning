To the 3,000,000
people who started
smoking this year.

Despite all the arguments against smoking, one simple fact
remains. Last year, three million people started to smoke.

This year, the criticism will continue. And next year, too. But
after all is said and done, another three million people will probably
start smoking.

Maybe the people who criticize smoking should stare the facts
in the face. Then they might recommend that if you've decided to
smoke, but are concerned about ‘tar’ and nicotine, you might smoke
Vantage.

Vantage offers smokers the rich, tobacco flavor they've come
to appreciate. With a substantial cut in ‘tar’and nicotine.

So if you're one of those smokers who is now deciding between
high ‘tar and nicotine cigarettes that taste good, and low ‘tar’
and nicotine cigarettes that taste like nothing, you might appreciate
Vantage. ==

Because Vantage is both high in flavorand
low in ‘tar’ and nicotine.

That's why so many people who have
smoked for many years have switched to Vantage.
And that’s why, if you've just
started to smoke this year, we suggest you

try Vantage yourself
