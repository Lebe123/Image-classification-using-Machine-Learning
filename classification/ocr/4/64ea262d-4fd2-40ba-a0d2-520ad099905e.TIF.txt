Quit smoking, one craving at a time.

Craving a cigarette is the #4 reason why people relapse to smoking. Nicorette gum
provides nicotine to ease your cravings, without the tars, toxins, and other carcinogens
you'd get from cigarettes. And with Nicorette’s flexible dosing schedule, you deal with

one craving at a time. Plus, you keep your hands and mouth busy with something that's
NOT a cigarette. No other product gives you this much control.

The Nicorette Committed Quitters program is your partner throughout your quitting process.
While Nicorette gum helps you break your physical addiction, the services offered
through the Nicorette Committed Quitters program can help you overcome your mental
desire to smoke. Call the toll-free number inside the Nicorette Starter Kit to enroll.
We'll design a personalized stop smoking support plan, just for you. The Nicorette
Committed Quitters program will help you throughout your quit attempt with a quitting
calendar, exercises, tips and $300 worth of valuable offers for non-smokers.
Nicorette is an investment in you.

Over the course of therapy, Nicorette costs about the same as a
pack-and-a-hal-a-day habit. But you don’t use Nicorette forever.
So over a ten year period of not smoking you'll save around
$10,000. And you just
might save your life.
