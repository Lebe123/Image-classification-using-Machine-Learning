It's tough growing up.

And, we need our parents more
than they realize.

You don't want to be told what
to do, but you do want to know
what they think.

Parents need to know something
too. No one's going to come
home and say: "Hey Mom, do you
think I should drink or smoke?"

So parents have to be the ones
who speak up first.

A lot of us will listen, even
if we don't like to admit it.

Narrator (voice-over:

Everybody needs help talking to
their kids sometimes. Call for
your free booklet on how
parents can talk to their
teenagers about smoking and
other issues. The Family
COURSE Consortium believes
smoking should not be a part of
growing up.
