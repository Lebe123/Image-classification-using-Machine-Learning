LESS IRRITATING...

Cigarettes made by the ordinary
‘method of manufacture produce an irrita-
tion of the nose and throat that is noticeably
absent when smoking Philip Morris.

 

‘Sciemific research” shows that ciga-
rettes in which diethylene glycol is used, are
definitely less irritating—a major improve-
‘ment in cigarettes.

In Philip Morris diethylene glycol is
used exclusively as the hygroscopic agent.
