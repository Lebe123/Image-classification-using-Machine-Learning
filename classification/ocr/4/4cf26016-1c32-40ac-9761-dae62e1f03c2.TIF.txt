You've probably heard anti-
‘smoking groups calling for more
laws against smoking in public.
Because, they say or imply, it’s a
ict that smoke causes
disease in non-smokers.

But the fact is, it simply has
never been shown that smoke
causes disease in non-smokers.

Here's what an eminent doe-
tor who was an advisor to the
Surgeon General's Committee
was quoted as saying in 1976: “In
very direct terms there is no med-
ical proof that non-smokers ex-
posed to cigarette smoke in
ordinary relation with smokers
suffer any damage."*

There's much more testimony
like that. From government agen-
cies, other doctors, researchers,
medical investigators. Much of it
from sources that are strongly

  

 

against. smoking. Some of it is
quoted in the box at the right.

Certainly smokers and non-
smokers can sometimes annoy
one another. But what's needed to
solve that problem is more cour-
tesy, not more laws.

More and more Americans are
coming to believe that govern-
ment interference isn't the answer
toevery problem. We agree.
