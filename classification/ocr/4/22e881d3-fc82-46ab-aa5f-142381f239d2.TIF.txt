Scenes of Parents Father to Camera:

There's joy in watching your
kids grow up -- and worry, too.

Mother to Camera:

There's so much peer pressure
today.

Father to Camera:

We know it can be hard to talk
to teenagers about not smoking
=- but if you can do that, you
can ‘talk to them about
drinking, AIDS and sex too.

Mother to Camera:

Sometimes it may be difficult
for a parent to believe, but
you're the voice they want to
hear the most.

Narrator (voice-over):

Everybody needs help talking to
their kids sometimes. Call for
your free booklet on how
parents can talk to their
teenagers about smoking and
other issues. The Family
COURSE Consortium believes
smoking should not be a part of
growing up.
