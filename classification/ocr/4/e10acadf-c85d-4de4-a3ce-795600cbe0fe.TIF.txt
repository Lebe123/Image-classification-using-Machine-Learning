Smoking.
Whatare you going to do

aboutit?:

Many people are against cigarettes. Youve heard their arguments.

And vwersthough we're inthe ‘business of selling ci etes,
we're not going to advance arguments in favor of smoking.

We simply want to discuss one irrefutable fact.

Alot off people are still smoking cigarettes. In all likelihood,
they'll continue to smoke cigarettes and nothing anybody has said
oris likely to say is going to change their minds.

Now, if you're one of these cigarette smokers, what are you

‘ing to do about it? You may continue to smoke your present
Frand. With all the enjoyment and pleasure you get from smoking
it. Or if ‘tar’ and nicotine has becomea concern to you, you may
consider changing toa cigarette like Vantage.

(Ofcourse, there is no other cigarette quite like Vantage.)

Vantage has a unique filter that allows rich flavor to come
through itand yet substantially cuts down on ‘tar and nicotine.

We want to be frank. Vantage is not the
lowest ‘tar’ and nicotine cigarette you can buy. |»
But it may well be the lowest ‘tar’ and nicotine
cigarette you will enjoy smoking.

Vantage. It's the only cigarette that
gives you so much taste with so little 'tar’ gg
and nicotine. 3

‘We suggest you try a pack.
