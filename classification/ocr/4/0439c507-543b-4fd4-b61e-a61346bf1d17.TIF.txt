Radio :60 8/27/85

YOU KNOW, WAY BACK IN 1966, THE SURGEON GENERAL
REQUIRED CIGARETTE COMPANIES TO PUT A LABEL ON THEIR
CIGARETTE PACKAGES: "CAUTION: CIGARETTE SMOKING MAY BE

HAZARDOUS TO (OUR HEALTH."
THEN, IN 1971, IT CHANGED TO: "WARNING: THE

SURGEON GENERAL HAS DETERMINED THAT CIGARETTE SMOKING IS
DANGEROUS TO YOUR HEALTH.”

NOW, :N 1985, THERE ARE FOUR NEW WARNINGS FROM THE
SURGEON GENERAL: "WARNING: SMOKING CAUSES LUNG CANCER,
HEART DISEASE. EMPHYSEMA, AND MAY COMPLICATE PREGNANCY."

++ “MARNING: SMOKING BY PREGNANT WOMEN MAY RESULT
IN FETAL INJUitY, PREMATURE BIRTH AND LOW BIRTH WEIGHT." ...

+++ "WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKE CONTAINS CARBON
MONOXIDE." ...

+++ "WARNING: QUITTING SMOKING NOW GREATLY REDUCES
SERIOUS RISKS TO YOUR HEALTH."

NOW, !F THIS ISN'T ENOUGH TO GET YOU TO QUIT SMOKING,
DOES IT MEAN ANYTHING MORE TO YOU TO KNOW THAT THIS
INFORMATION Is BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE AMERICAN HEART
ASSOCIATION, HE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION, AND THE
AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY?
